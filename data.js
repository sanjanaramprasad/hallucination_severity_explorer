      "summary": "Shanghai is testing a unisex public restroom in a park to reduce wait times for women, who often face longer lines than men. The facility will have 10 stalls, urinals, and a disabled-accessible stall. Officials hope the unisex design will eliminate the need to allocate stalls by gender, but some citizens have expressed reservations about the idea. The trial is set to begin on World Toilet Day, and attendants will ensure safety and privacy. There are currently no plans to build more unisex restrooms, as authorities are unsure of public acceptance.",
