           "source":"[doctor] hello larry how are you doing today [patient] i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you for this back pain that i've been having for a couple of years now [doctor] okay [patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially [patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend [doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me [patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe [doctor] okay [patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah [doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain [patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot [doctor] okay [patient] let me separate these [doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area [patient] no nothing like that [doctor] okay now do you have any weakness [patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no [doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels [patient] no [doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they [patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery [doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like [patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years [doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf [patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back [doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right [patient] exactly [doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions [patient] no i ca n't recall any family members [doctor] okay alright and do you smoke [patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago [doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here [patient] okay [doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit [patient] okay that's painful [doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that [patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time [doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year [patient] okay okay [doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour [patient] okay [doctor] okay [patient] alright sounds good [doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection [patient] alright thank you [doctor] alright thank you [patient] bye",
           "summary":"Larry, the patient, visited his doctor following a referral from his primary care physician for persistent back pain trouble which he had been experiencing for a number of years. The pain began after he moved furniture one weekend and it has since emanated down his leg and even to his toe. He also had numbness and a tingling sensation in his right leg and foot. Larry has made attempts toward various treatments such as physical therapy and strong pain medications without having much success. As a result of his condition, he was unable to lead an active lifestyle, resulting in weight gain. He mentioned having no family history of spinal conditions and was a non-smoker.",

?\n[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years .\nBut i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .\n[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .\n[patient] okay , that's reassuring .\n[doctor] yeah .\nSo what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having .\nAnd then i'll do a quick exam .\n[patient] okay .\nThat sounds good .\n[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails .\nAnd , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?\n[patient] i have blue cross blue shield .\nWell , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .\n[doctor] okay .\nWhat we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company .\nAnd what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not .\nBut we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance .\nDo you know when you'll be on the new plan ?\n[patient] most likely july .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?\n[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years .\nI do have a lotta pain here and here .\nBut i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not .\nIt gets painful and builds up .\nSo i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd in your neck and your upper back .\nAnd how long has this been going on ?\nWould you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?\n[patient] i would say since i was in high school .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ?\nUm , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .\n[patient] yes .\nI do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often .\nI mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable .\nAnd the others are expensive in my size .\n[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well .\nAnd , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?\n[patient] no , i do not have any kids now .\nBut we might plan to in the future .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?\n[patient] sometimes , yes .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ?\nAnd , and it could be from sweating .\n[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?\n[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running .\nAnd it hurts .\n[doctor] and it hurts , okay .\nAnd , and you saw a chiropractor .\nBut what about physical therapy for your back pain ?\nOr do you take any pain medicine for it ?\n[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .\n[doctor] that's okay .\nSo let's see .\nI know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family .\nHave you had any mammograms ?\nAnd how old was your mother when she had it ?\n[patient] mom was 40 .\nAnd they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram .\nI'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 .\nSo i'm still a little bit young .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?\n[patient] yes , for the most part .\nI lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .\n[doctor] congratulations .\nThat's great .\nAnd then , um- [patient] thank you .\n[doctor] .\nSo then ... you're welcome .\nAnd so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ?\nAnd then , um , you said that you were going to school .\nWhat are you going to school for ?\n[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .\n[doctor] okay , that's great .\nAll right .\nSo what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look .\nI'm gon na take a couple of measurements .\nAnd we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards .\nUm , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia .\nOkay .\nSo , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] okay .\nWell , thank you so much .\nIt looks like i have all the measurements that we need .\nYou can go ahead and cover up now .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction .\nWhen we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .\n[patient] okay .\nThat's fine .\n[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .\n[patient] right .",

           "source":"[doctor] patient is julia jones , date of birth 5/16/1996 .\nShe is a new breast reduction consult .\nHello , how are you doing today ?\nI'm dr. gonzalez .\nIt's nice to meet you .\n[patient] nice to meet you , ma'am .\nHow are you ?\n[doctor] i'm doing good , thank you .\nSo you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ?\n[patient] yes .\nThat's right .\n[doctor] okay .\nPerfect .\nLet me just get logged in , here .\nHave you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?\n[patient] no , i have n't .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how long have you been considering this ?\n[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years .\nBut i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .\n[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .\n[patient] okay , that's reassuring .\n[doctor] yeah .\nSo what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having .\nAnd then i'll do a quick exam .\n[patient] okay .\nThat sounds good .\n[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails .\nAnd , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?\n[patient] i have blue cross blue shield .\nWell , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .\n[doctor] okay .\nWhat we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company .\nAnd what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not .\nBut we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance .\nDo you know when you'll be on the new plan ?\n[patient] most likely july .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?\n[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years .\nI do have a lotta pain here and here .\nBut i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not .\nIt gets painful and builds up .\nSo i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd in your neck and your upper back .\nAnd how long has this been going on ?\nWould you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?\n[patient] i would say since i was in high school .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ?\nUm , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .\n[patient] yes .\nI do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often .\nI mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable .\nAnd the others are expensive in my size .\n[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well .\nAnd , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?\n[patient] no , i do not have any kids now .\nBut we might plan to in the future .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?\n[patient] sometimes , yes .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ?\nAnd , and it could be from sweating .\n[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?\n[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running .\nAnd it hurts .\n[doctor] and it hurts , okay .\nAnd , and you saw a chiropractor .\nBut what about physical therapy for your back pain ?\nOr do you take any pain medicine for it ?\n[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .\n[doctor] that's okay .\nSo let's see .\nI know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family .\nHave you had any mammograms ?\nAnd how old was your mother when she had it ?\n[patient] mom was 40 .\nAnd they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram .\nI'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 .\nSo i'm still a little bit young .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?\n[patient] yes , for the most part .\nI lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .\n[doctor] congratulations .\nThat's great .\nAnd then , um- [patient] thank you .\n[doctor] .\nSo then ... you're welcome .\nAnd so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ?\nAnd then , um , you said that you were going to school .\nWhat are you going to school for ?\n[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .\n[doctor] okay , that's great .\nAll right .\nSo what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look .\nI'm gon na take a couple of measurements .\nAnd we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards .\nUm , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia .\nOkay .\nSo , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] okay .\nWell , thank you so much .\nIt looks like i have all the measurements that we need .\nYou can go ahead and cover up now .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction .\nWhen we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .\n[patient] okay .\nThat's fine .\n[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .\n[patient] right .",
           "summary":"Julia Jones, a new patient for Dr. Gonzalez, came in for a breast reduction consultation. This is something she has been considering for about six or seven years due to a variety of symptoms including back pain, shoulder bra strap indentations, and some limitations to her activities. The breast reduction procedure aims to address these issues, and as a plastic surgeon, Dr. Gonzalez will also be concerned with aesthetic outcomes. Due to a potential change in insurance, they will wait until July to submit the information for approval. Julia also disclosed she does not have children currently but may plan to in the future, and that she sometimes experiences numbness and tingling. She denied having rashes, but mentioned constant sweating. Julia has a family history of breast cancer",

The wound had been present for a couple of weeks and was caused by new shoes that were too tight. The doctor checked the foot, noting a one by two inch circular wound, with no other signs of infection or complications. The patient's X-rays also didn't show any evidence of osteomyelitis, which indicates there's no bone infection. The doctor decided to order an ABI exam to determine the blood supply to the foot, perform a debridement, prescribe a collagenase ointment, and recommend a surgical shoe to reduce pressure on the affected area.",

good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse [doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there [patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time [doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version [patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden [doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at [patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month [doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes [patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here [doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me [patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg [doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life [patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten [doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better [patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down [doctor] okay [patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today [doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs [patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well [doctor] that's okay [patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day [doctor] absolutely [patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them [doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here [patient] no it's right here [doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there [patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks [doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please [patient] okay that's it that's all i got [doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan [patient] sure sounds good [doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you",

           "source":"[doctor] so jerry is a 45 -year-old male who came in today with an ankle injury jerry what happened [patient] hey doctor michael yeah so my son sean i think you met in the past he he started playing basketball and there we do multiple seasons and so we're kinda getting ready for the next season that starts in in april and we were at the courts plan and i went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers i guess he could say and so he he found me while i was going for a lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen [doctor] yeah [patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym [doctor] okay [patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so [doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way [patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys [doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad [patient] yeah yes [doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too [patient] yeah a little bit [doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all [patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid [doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable [patient] yeah [doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches [patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach [doctor] great [patient] starting in april so [doctor] alright well [patient] how long [doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again [patient] okay [doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly [patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out [doctor] yeah i i'm a dog walker as well so alright sorry for the bad news but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do [patient] alright thank you doctor [doctor] alright thanks",
           "summary":"A 45-year-old male, Jerry, visited the doctor due to an ankle injury sustained while playing basketball with his 10-year-old son. X-rays revealed a displaced lateral malleolus at the Weber C level, which is unstable and will require surgery to heal. Jerry will be out for about three months and will need to use crutches during that time. The doctor prescribed meloxicam to help reduce swelling and recommended elevating and icing the ankle to manage pain. Jerry is a dog walker and is worried about how he will manage his dog-walking business during his recovery.",

now [doctor] okay [patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially [patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend [doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me [patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe [doctor] okay [patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah [doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain [patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot [doctor] okay [patient] let me separate these [doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area [patient] no nothing like that [doctor] okay now do you have any weakness [patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no [doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels [patient] no [doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they [patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery [doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like [patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years [doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf [patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back [doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right [patient] exactly [doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions [patient] no i ca n't recall any family members [doctor] okay alright and do you smoke [patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago [doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here [patient] okay [doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit [patient] okay that's painful [doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that [patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time [doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year [patient] okay okay [doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour [patient] okay [doctor] okay [patient] alright sounds good [doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection [patient] alright thank you [doctor] alright thank you [patient] bye",

better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all [patient] hmmm hmmm [doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that [patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me [doctor] okay [patient] so i do n't try to go there often [doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam [patient] okay",

anything for pain or the swelling or anything like that [patient] ibuprofen some ice and elevation [doctor] okay has that helped much or not really [patient] a little bit [doctor] okay and any pain above your ankle does it hurt on your on your calf or your lower leg at all or knee at all [patient] no it's mostly just the outside of my ankle [doctor] okay got it and no bleeding or i'm sure it's a

how how're you managing that any issues with that [patient] no they've been pretty stable [doctor] okay [patient] so with my diet [doctor] good [patient] so [doctor] you're checking your sugars regularly as well [patient] yes [doctor] okay your hemoglobin a1c last time i looked at epic was about six .\nEight which is really good so i think you're doing a great job we had talked about you know cutting off the sweets and sugars and stuff like that and exercising so it sounds like you're you're you're doing a pretty good job with that have you seen the ophthalmologist recently for your eye exam for your diabetes checkup or no [patient] i am due for one of those in the next couple of weeks [doctor] okay alright so we'll so you do you already have an appointment or do you need to make an appointment for that [patient] i have an appointment [doctor] perfect excellent okay and how is your blood pressure been i know we watching it your blood pressure today looks pretty good it's about one seventy over i'm sorry one twenty over seventy you're taking norvasc any issues with that any do you need any refills or anything [patient] i need a refill on that yes [doctor] okay alright well let me examine you here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my match exam and i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put that into my record okay so your neck exam is fine there is no bruits your lungs are clear your heart exam is normal you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is i think you probably have an ankle sprain but i would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone and i'm sometimes worried about a fracture so i'm gon na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you [patient] that's a great plan i need to get back to exercising so [doctor] okay [patient] thank you [doctor] perfect and for the diabetes keep the eye appointment that you already have you know continue with the metformin i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check some baseline labs as well since it's been a while since we checked them and then once if you have any issues or you know give me a call we can get you into the office and for the high blood pressure i'll go ahead and refill the norvasc today you're doing a great job with that it sounds like continue to monitor that if something changes certainly call me we can get you in sooner okay [patient] thank you [doctor] sounds good sounds good good great seeing you thanks stephanie [patient]

           "summary":"Dr. Cooper met with Ms. James, a 42-year-old female who experienced a skiing accident on a double black diamond trail. She injured her right index finger but escaped other injuries. She had been experiencing pain for five days, which she rated as seven out of ten. Her x-ray showed a normal right hand. Ms. James has a sprain of her distal interphalangeal joint, also known as the DIP joint, of her right index finger. Dr. Cooper prescribed a splint, a strong anti-inflammatory called Mobic, and a follow-up visit in two weeks to evaluate healing and possibly start hand therapy if needed.",

This caused an error to occur and resulted in a blank screen and issues with booting up. The student realised his hard drive was potentially damaged. His roommates were supportive and lent him one of their laptops to finish his assignment, but he still needed to get it repaired. Facing both financial issues and timing conflicts, it took him a week to get his laptop to a repair center.

           "source":"[doctor] patient is julia jones , date of birth 5/16/1996 .\nShe is a new breast reduction consult .\nHello , how are you doing today ?\nI'm dr. gonzalez .\nIt's nice to meet you .\n[patient] nice to meet you , ma'am .\nHow are you ?\n[doctor] i'm doing good , thank you .\nSo you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ?\n[patient] yes .\nThat's right .\n[doctor] okay .\nPerfect .\nLet me just get logged in , here .\nHave you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?\n[patient] no , i have n't .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how long have you been considering this ?\n[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years .\nBut i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .\n[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .\n[patient] okay , that's reassuring .\n[doctor] yeah .\nSo what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having .\nAnd then i'll do a quick exam .\n[patient] okay .\nThat sounds good .\n[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails .\nAnd , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?\n[patient] i have blue cross blue shield .\nWell , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .\n[doctor] okay .\nWhat we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company .\nAnd what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not .\nBut we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance .\nDo you know when you'll be on the new plan ?\n[patient] most likely july .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?\n[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years .\nI do have a lotta pain here and here .\nBut i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not .\nIt gets painful and builds up .\nSo i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd in your neck and your upper back .\nAnd how long has this been going on ?\nWould you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?\n[patient] i would say since i was in high school .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ?\nUm , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .\n[patient] yes .\nI do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often .\nI mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable .\nAnd the others are expensive in my size .\n[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well .\nAnd , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?\n[patient] no , i do not have any kids now .\nBut we might plan to in the future .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?\n[patient] sometimes , yes .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ?\nAnd , and it could be from sweating .\n[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?\n[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running .\nAnd it hurts .\n[doctor] and it hurts , okay .\nAnd , and you saw a chiropractor .\nBut what about physical therapy for your back pain ?\nOr do you take any pain medicine for it ?\n[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .\n[doctor] that's okay .\nSo let's see .\nI know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family .\nHave you had any mammograms ?\nAnd how old was your mother when she had it ?\n[patient] mom was 40 .\nAnd they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram .\nI'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 .\nSo i'm still a little bit young .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?\n[patient] yes , for the most part .\nI lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .\n[doctor] congratulations .\nThat's great .\nAnd then , um- [patient] thank you .\n[doctor] .\nSo then ... you're welcome .\nAnd so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ?\nAnd then , um , you said that you were going to school .\nWhat are you going to school for ?\n[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .\n[doctor] okay , that's great .\nAll right .\nSo what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look .\nI'm gon na take a couple of measurements .\nAnd we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards .\nUm , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia .\nOkay .\nSo , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] okay .\nWell , thank you so much .\nIt looks like i have all the measurements that we need .\nYou can go ahead and cover up now .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction .\nWhen we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .\n[patient] okay .\nThat's fine .\n[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .\n[patient] right .",

have you had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks [patient] okay sounds great thanks document [doctor] alright great",
           "summary":"Gregory, a patient with diabetes, visited his doctor due to his concern about a non-healing foot ulcer which he had for about two months. The ulcer had recently become red and has been draining, a development that had not occurred before. His foot trauma may have been caused by walking barefoot on a beach, and although he had been prescribed medication, he had yet to pick them up from the pharmacy. In addition, his diabetes was not being well-controlled, evident through his high A1C of around ten. Upon inspection, the doctor confirmed redness, swelling, and drainage from the ulcer, but no bone infection, necrosis, or bony exposure were found.",

good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse [doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there [patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time [doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version [patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden [doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at [patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month [doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes [patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here [doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me [patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg [doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life [patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten [doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better [patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down [doctor] okay [patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today [doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs [patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well [doctor] that's okay [patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day [doctor] absolutely [patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them [doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here [patient] no it's right here [doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there [patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks [doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please [patient] okay that's it that's all i got [doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan [patient] sure sounds good

He also experiences weakness in his back and legs, and coughing or sneezing worsens the pain. A physical exam revealed pain upon palpation at the L4 vertebrae, pain with flexion and extension of the back, and reduced strength in the left leg. An MRI showed a disk herniation at L4 L5 with nerve root impingement. The doctor recommended an epidural steroid injection to reduce inflammation and referred him back to physical therapy. The doctor advised that it could take two to three weeks for the injection to take full effect and asked him to return for a follow-up",

did a jump and kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since [doctor] okay so that was about five days ago then [patient] yeah yeah that was last weekend [doctor] last weekend okay now which knee is it [patient] it's my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened [patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards [doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance [patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore [doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before [patient] no that was the first time [doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake [patient] lake martin [doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier [patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can [doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day [patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway [doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked [patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days [doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing [patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it [doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all [patient] no just the swelling and the pain [doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain [patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day [doctor] okay and [patient] putting a cold pack on it [doctor] okay and has that helped at all [patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though [doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here [patient] i had my tonsils out [doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press [patient] yeah that's sore [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt [patient] yeah do n't do that anymore [doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that [patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan [doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions [patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me [doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye [patient] thank you",

.\n[patient] nice to meet you , ma'am .\nHow are you ?\n[doctor] i'm doing good , thank you .\nSo you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ?\n[patient] yes .\nThat's right .\n[doctor] okay .\nPerfect .\nLet me just get logged in , here .\nHave you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?\n[patient] no , i have n't .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how long have you been considering this ?\n[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years .\nBut i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .\n[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .\n[patient] okay , that's reassuring .\n[doctor] yeah .\nSo what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having .\nAnd then i'll do a quick exam .\n[patient] okay .\nThat sounds good .\n[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails .\nAnd , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?\n[patient] i have blue cross blue shield .\nWell , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .\n[doctor] okay .\nWhat we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company .\nAnd what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not .\nBut we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance .\nDo you know when you'll be on the new plan ?\n[patient] most likely july .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?\n[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years .\nI do have a lotta pain here and here .\nBut i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not .\nIt gets painful and builds up .\nSo i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd in your neck and your upper back .\nAnd how long has this been going on ?\nWould you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?\n[patient] i would say since i was in high school .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ?\nUm , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .\n[patient] yes .\nI do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often .\nI mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable .\nAnd the others are expensive in my size .\n[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well .\nAnd , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?\n[patient] no , i do not have any kids now .\nBut we might plan to in the future .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?\n[patient] sometimes , yes .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ?\nAnd , and it could be from sweating .\n[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?\n[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running .\nAnd it hurts .\n[doctor] and it hurts , okay .\nAnd , and you saw a chiropractor .\nBut what about physical therapy for your back pain ?\nOr do you take any pain medicine for it ?\n[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .\n[doctor] that's okay .\nSo let's see .\nI know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family .\nHave you had any mammograms ?\nAnd how old was your mother when she had it ?\n[patient] mom was 40 .\nAnd they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram .\nI'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 .\nSo i'm still a little bit young .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?\n[patient] yes , for the most part .\nI lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .\n[doctor] congratulations .\nThat's great .\nAnd then , um- [patient] thank you .\n[doctor] .\nSo then ... you're welcome .\nAnd so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ?\nAnd then , um , you said that you were going to school .\nWhat are you going to school for ?\n[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .\n[doctor] okay , that's great .\nAll right .\nSo what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look .\nI'm gon na take a couple of measurements .\nAnd we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards .\nUm , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia .\nOkay .\nSo , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] okay .\nWell , thank you so much .\nIt looks like i have all the measurements that we need .\nYou can go ahead and cover up now .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction .\nWhen we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .\n[patient] okay .\nThat's fine .\n[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .\n[patient] right .",
           "summary":"Julia Jones, a 25-year-old woman, visited Dr. Gonzalez for a breast reduction consultation. She had been considering the procedure for about six or seven years due to experiencing back and neck pain, as well as bra strap indentations and discomfort. She had not had any children but planned to in the future. Dr. Gonzalez examined Julia and took measurements, determining that she was a good candidate for the surgery. The doctor explained that during a breast reduction, tissue would be removed and the breasts would be lifted to alleviate Julia's pain and improve their appearance.",

           "source":"[doctor] hey hi bobby how are you doing [patient] i'm doing good how are you [doctor] i'm doing fine so i understand you're here having some left or some right shoulder pain that you've had for a few weeks now [patient] yeah it was i was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know i was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just has n't been going away [doctor] okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before [patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so [doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not [patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it [doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go [patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain [doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also [patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so [doctor] okay [patient] of course [doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that [patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it [doctor] okay and does that seem to help or [patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit [doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and [patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift [doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then [patient] yeah [doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or [patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of [doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven .\nEight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan [patient] no that sounds good [doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay [patient] sounds great [doctor] okay thanks [patient] thanks [doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or [patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but [doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that [patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good",
           "summary":"Bobby, a patient, visits the doctor complaining of right shoulder pain that has persisted for a few weeks. He describes the pain as being located on the outside of his shoulder and worsening with movement. The pain also bothers him at night when he sleeps on that side. He has tried taking Advil and icing the area, which provides some relief. On physical examination, the doctor notes limited active and passive range of motion, tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus, and no tenderness at other joints. X-rays show no fracture. The doctor suspects rotator cuff tendinopathy and orders an MRI to rule out other issues. He also recommends physical therapy for six to eight weeks and suggests considering a steroid injection if symptoms do not improve",

[patient] no nothing like that [doctor] okay now do you have any weakness [patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no [doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels [patient] no [doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they [patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery [doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like [patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years [doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf [patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back [doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right [patient] exactly [doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions [patient] no i ca n't recall any family members [doctor] okay alright and do you smoke [patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago [doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here [patient] okay [doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit [patient] okay that's painful [doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that [patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time [doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year [patient] okay okay [doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour [patient] okay [doctor] okay [patient] alright sounds good [doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection [patient] alright thank you [doctor] alright thank you [patient] bye",
           "summary":"Larry, a patient, consulted a doctor about his chronic lower back pain that started after moving furniture. He has tried physical therapy, pain medication, and considered surgery. The doctor performed a physical exam, reviewed his MRI results, and diagnosed him with an L4-L5 herniated disk with radiculopathy. The doctor suggested a spinal injection with a corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. The procedure is relatively quick and requires monitoring to determine the appropriate intervals between injections, with a maximum of four injections per year. The patient agreed, and they scheduled the first injection.",

he started playing basketball and there we do multiple seasons and so we're kinda getting ready for the next season that starts in in april and we were at the courts plan and i went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers i guess he could say and so he he found me while i was going for a lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen [doctor] yeah [patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym [doctor] okay [patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so [doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way [patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys [doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad [patient] yeah yes [doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too [patient] yeah a little bit [doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all [patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid [doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable [patient] yeah [doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches [patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach [doctor] great [patient] starting in april so [doctor] alright well [patient] how long [doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again [patient] okay [doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly [patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out [doctor] yeah i i'm a dog walker as well so alright sorry for the bad news but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do [patient] alright thank you doctor [doctor] alright thanks",

           "summary":"The document is a conversation between a doctor and his patient, Albert, a 62-year-old male with a medical history of depression, type 2 diabetes, and kidney transplant. Albert recently visited the emergency room due to feeling woozy as he was not monitoring his blood sugar levels. His blood sugar levels were high at that time due to unhealthy eating patterns in the past week when his mother was in the hospital for a hip replacement surgery. Albert is feeling better now and has resumed following his diet closely. However, he does admit to being inconsistent with his diet on weekends. Besides, Albert has been diligent about his immunotherapy meds post the kidney transplant and his kidney function is good.",

           "source":"[patient] hi kenneth how are you the medical assistant told me that you had some knee pain yeah i was getting ready for the holiday weekend and i was out on my boat skiing and i i did a jump and kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since [doctor] okay so that was about five days ago then [patient] yeah yeah that was last weekend [doctor] last weekend okay now which knee is it [patient] it's my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened [patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards [doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance [patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore [doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before [patient] no that was the first time [doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake [patient] lake martin [doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier [patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can [doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day [patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway [doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked [patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days [doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing [patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it [doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all [patient] no just the swelling and the pain [doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain [patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day [doctor] okay and [patient] putting a cold pack on it [doctor] okay and has that helped at all [patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though [doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here [patient] i had my tonsils out [doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press [patient] yeah that's sore [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt [patient] yeah do n't do that anymore [doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that [patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan [doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions [patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me [doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye [patient] thank you",

sandra who injured her knee cold dancing so that would immediately came up to mine but let's try skiing so i was skiing in vermont last weekend and i caught my ski when i was coming off the lift and i fell and my knee popped and it's hurt ever since [doctor] okay and were you able to ski down the hill or did you have to be taken down by the ski patrol [patient] i had to be taken down by the ski patrol i was unable to bear weight [doctor] okay is n't that slightly terrifying they had to do the same thing for me and you're just kind of sitting there watching all of the trees go by so anyway so what part of your knee is bothering you the most is it the inside the outside [patient] it hurts on the outside but it also feels like it wo n't hold my weight [doctor] okay so it feels like it's gon na buckle [patient] hmmm yes [doctor] okay alright and are you able to bend it [patient] i was immediately after the injury but not really now [doctor] okay and how about straightening it are you able to straighten it at all [patient] somewhat but it really hurts when i try to straighten all the way [doctor] okay alright now do you have any numbing or tingling in your toes [patient] no [doctor] okay and can you feel your toes okay [patient] i think so [doctor] okay alright now are you a pretty active person you said you were skiing do you do what kind of other activities do you do [patient] i chase my two four -year-old [doctor] okay do you have twins [patient] i do [doctor] nice that's great [patient] yeah [doctor] so okay and what's your support like at home who is who is able to help out are you still doing that kind of hobbling around on crutches or [patient] yeah now my husband is home with me but he also works a job where he is gone quite a bit so it's just me and the kids [doctor] okay alright and did the ski patrol give you crutches i i see you have them here with you okay alright great and are you otherwise generally healthy [patient] yes [doctor] okay and no high blood pressure diabetes anything like that [patient] mm-hmm [doctor] no okay alright and well i i wan na go ahead let me just do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay alright so on your heart exam your heart sounds in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation and remind me what knee did you injure again [patient] my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay so on your right knee examination i do appreciate some edema and an effusion over the right knee does it hurt when i press [patient] yes [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right lateral knee there is decreased flexion and extension there is a positive lachman sign there is a palpable palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is no leg edema in the ankle okay well let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and you know my plan for you so you know i know that you had the x-ray done of your of your right knee that did n't show any bony abnormality but i i'm concerned that you have ruptured your your acl or your anterior cruciate ligament that's like a major ligament that helps connect and helps your knee move back and forth so i wan na go ahead and order a knee mri just so that we can get a a a good look and just you know confirm that physical exam okay now some people can have a normal physical exam and their acl can still be torn but you do have a lot of pain on the lateral aspect of your knee so i wan na make sure if there make sure that there is not any other structures that have been damaged by this accident okay i wan na go ahead and you know are you what are you taking for the pain [patient] ibuprofen [doctor] is that helping [patient] somewhat yes [doctor] okay alright do you want something stronger [patient] no i'm okay [doctor] alright so let's just continue with ibuprofen you can take you know six hundred to eight hundred milligrams every eight hours as needed i wan na go ahead and put you in a brace that's gon na help your knee feel a bit more supported okay and let's go ahead and i'm hoping that we can get this mri done in you know the next couple days and then we can have a conversation about what needs to be done now you said that you are are are you know obviously a very active active mom any other exercise or anything else that that i should be aware of that you do just wondering in terms of which kind of graft we would use to fix this with your with your acl being injured [patient] hmmm no i not i i would like to get back to the running but currently not that active [doctor] okay alright alright do you have any questions about anything [patient] i think you've explained it well [doctor] okay alright so i'll see you again soon okay [patient] okay thank you [doctor] alright take care bye",
           "summary":"During a skiing trip, Michelle injured her right knee while coming off a ski lift. She was unable to bear weight on her injured knee and had to be taken down by ski patrol. She experienced pain on the outside of the knee, difficulty bending and straightening it, but she had no numbness or tingling in her toes. Her physical exam showed swelling, effusion, pain upon palpation, and a positive Lachman sign. The doctor suspected a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament and ordered an MRI to confirm. She was advised to continue taking ibuprofen for pain management, wear a brace for support, and avoid strenuous activities. The doctor planned to discuss further treatment options after reviewing the MRI results.",

were you able to get up afterwards or somebody helped you up [patient] i was but it was very sore and then started swelling and quite a bit of pain so it's hard to walk [doctor] sure have you tried anything for pain or the swelling or anything like that [patient] ibuprofen some ice and elevation [doctor] okay has that helped much or not really [patient] a little bit [doctor] okay and any pain above your ankle does it hurt on your on your calf or your lower leg at all or knee at all [patient] no it's mostly just the outside of my ankle [doctor] okay got it and no bleeding or i'm sure it's a little swollen probably [patient] yeah it's swollen but no bleeding [doctor] well i'll have you take off your shoes in a second we'll examine you in a second but since you're here and i wanted to talk about some of your other things that you know we have n't i have n't seen you in a year so let's talk about your history of diabetes as well are you taking the metformin how's your blood sugars been how how're you managing that any issues with that [patient] no they've been pretty stable [doctor] okay [patient] so with my diet [doctor] good [patient] so [doctor] you're checking your sugars regularly as well [patient] yes [doctor] okay your hemoglobin a1c last time i looked at epic was about six .\nEight which is really good so i think you're doing a great job we had talked about you know cutting off the sweets and sugars and stuff like that and exercising so it sounds like you're you're you're doing a pretty good job with that have you seen the ophthalmologist recently for your eye exam for your diabetes checkup or no [patient] i am due for one of those in the next couple of weeks [doctor] okay alright so we'll so you do you already have an appointment or do you need to make an appointment for that [patient] i have an appointment [doctor] perfect excellent okay and how is your blood pressure been i know we watching it your blood pressure today looks pretty good it's about one seventy over i'm sorry one twenty over seventy you're taking norvasc any issues with that any do you need any refills or anything [patient] i need a refill on that yes [doctor] okay alright well let me examine you here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my match exam and i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put that into my record okay so your neck exam is fine there is no bruits your lungs are clear your heart exam is normal you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is i think you probably have an ankle sprain but i would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone and i'm sometimes worried about a fracture so i'm gon na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you [patient] that's a great plan i need to get back to exercising so [doctor] okay [patient] thank you [doctor] perfect and for the diabetes keep the eye appointment that you already have you know continue with the metformin i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check some baseline labs as well since it's been a while since we checked them and then once if you have any issues or you know give me a call we can get you into the office and for the high blood pressure i'll go ahead and refill the norvasc today you're doing a great job with that it sounds like continue to monitor that if something changes certainly call me we can get you in sooner okay [patient] thank you [doctor] sounds good sounds good good great seeing you thanks stephanie [patient] thank you",
           "summary":"Stephanie Morales, a 36-year-old female with a history of diabetes and high blood pressure, consulted her doctor due to bothersome ankle pain. Stephanie slipped on snow and ice two days prior, causing her ankle to twist under her, leading to swelling and pain. The doctor acknowledged her discomfort, checking her vital stats, and suggested that she had probably sprained her ankle. Notwithstanding, an x-ray was ordered to rule out a fracture. The doctor suggested an air splint, crutches, and Naprosyn for pain management, and no weight bearing was recommended until x-ray results were obtained. If a fracture was detected, Stephanie would be referred to orthopedics.",

now [doctor] okay [patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially [patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend [doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me [patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe [doctor] okay [patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah [doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain [patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot [doctor] okay [patient] let me separate these [doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area [patient] no nothing like that [doctor] okay now do you have any weakness [patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no [doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels [patient] no [doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they [patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery [doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like [patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years [doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf [patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back [doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right [patient] exactly [doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions [patient] no i ca n't recall any family members [doctor] okay alright and do you smoke [patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago [doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here [patient] okay [doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit [patient] okay that's painful [doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that [patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time [doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year [patient] okay okay [doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour [patient] okay [doctor] okay [patient] alright sounds good [doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection [patient] alright thank you [doctor] alright thank you [patient] bye",

The pain started after moving furniture and is described as a sharp, stabbing pain in the back that can radiate down to the right leg. The patient has tried physical therapy and pain medications in the past, but the pain persists. The doctor performed a physical examination and ordered an MRI, which revealed a herniated disk with nerve impingement. The doctor recommended a spinal injection with a corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. The patient is hesitant about the injection but is willing to give it a try.",

           "source":"[doctor] hey matthew i see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your pcp sent you over to see me how're you doing today [patient] pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse [doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there [patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time [doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version [patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden [doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at [patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month [doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes [patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here [doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me [patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg [doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life [patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten [doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better [patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down [doctor] okay [patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today [doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs [patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well [doctor] that's okay [patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day [doctor] absolutely [patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them [doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here [patient] no it's right here [doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there [patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks [doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please [patient] okay that's it that's all i got [doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan [patient] sure sounds good [doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you",
           "summary":"The patient, Matthew, has been experiencing long-term back pain that has worsened significantly in the past month, interfering with his ability to stand or walk and escalating to a point where he has been bedridden. He reported that the pain originates from his lower back area and extends through his left hip and leg, describing the feeling as akin to an electrical toothache. Notably, he had fallen off a roof thirty years ago, and subsequent investigations had indicated a possible fracture. On a scale of zero to ten, with ten being the most severe, Matthew rated his current pain as a six. However, he noted that it could escalate to thirteen in severe instances.",

           "summary":"Jose James, a new patient visiting a doctor named Isabella, reports experiencing persistent pain in his left shoulder and elbow for approximately five months. The pain originated from a fall up the stairs five months ago. Weightlifting activities exacerbate the pain, leading him to reduce his gym visits. While icing the affected areas and avoiding exercise provide some relief, the pain remains significant. The doctor suspects impingement syndrome in the left shoulder, potentially causing the wrist pain. Two treatment options are presented: physical therapy (initial preference) and cortisone injection if therapy fails. The doctor recommends icing, rest, and scheduling a physical therapy appointment soon. The patient expresses appreciation for the assistance and agrees to follow the recommended course of action.",

.\n[patient] nice to meet you , ma'am .\nHow are you ?\n[doctor] i'm doing good , thank you .\nSo you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ?\n[patient] yes .\nThat's right .\n[doctor] okay .\nPerfect .\nLet me just get logged in , here .\nHave you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?\n[patient] no , i have n't .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how long have you been considering this ?\n[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years .\nBut i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .\n[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .\n[patient] okay , that's reassuring .\n[doctor] yeah .\nSo what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having .\nAnd then i'll do a quick exam .\n[patient] okay .\nThat sounds good .\n[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails .\nAnd , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?\n[patient] i have blue cross blue shield .\nWell , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .\n[doctor] okay .\nWhat we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company .\nAnd what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not .\nBut we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance .\nDo you know when you'll be on the new plan ?\n[patient] most likely july .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?\n[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years .\nI do have a lotta pain here and here .\nBut i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not .\nIt gets painful and builds up .\nSo i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd in your neck and your upper back .\nAnd how long has this been going on ?\nWould you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?\n[patient] i would say since i was in high school .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ?\nUm , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .\n[patient] yes .\nI do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often .\nI mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable .\nAnd the others are expensive in my size .\n[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well .\nAnd , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?\n[patient] no , i do not have any kids now .\nBut we might plan to in the future .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?\n[patient] sometimes , yes .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ?\nAnd , and it could be from sweating .\n[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?\n[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running .\nAnd it hurts .\n[doctor] and it hurts , okay .\nAnd , and you saw a chiropractor .\nBut what about physical therapy for your back pain ?\nOr do you take any pain medicine for it ?\n[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .\n[doctor] that's okay .\nSo let's see .\nI know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family .\nHave you had any mammograms ?\nAnd how old was your mother when she had it ?\n[patient] mom was 40 .\nAnd they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram .\nI'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 .\nSo i'm still a little bit young .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?\n[patient] yes , for the most part .\nI lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .\n[doctor] congratulations .\nThat's great .\nAnd then , um- [patient] thank you .\n[doctor] .\nSo then ... you're welcome .\nAnd so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ?\nAnd then , um , you said that you were going to school .\nWhat are you going to school for ?\n[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .\n[doctor] okay , that's great .\nAll right .\nSo what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look .\nI'm gon na take a couple of measurements .\nAnd we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards .\nUm , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia .\nOkay .\nSo , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] okay .\nWell , thank you so much .\nIt looks like i have all the measurements that we need .\nYou can go ahead and cover up now .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction .\nWhen we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .\n[patient] okay .\nThat's fine .\n[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .\n[patient] right .",

sandra who injured her knee cold dancing so that would immediately came up to mine but let's try skiing so i was skiing in vermont last weekend and i caught my ski when i was coming off the lift and i fell and my knee popped and it's hurt ever since [doctor] okay and were you able to ski down the hill or did you have to be taken down by the ski patrol [patient] i had to be taken down by the ski patrol i was unable to bear weight [doctor] okay is n't that slightly terrifying they had to do the same thing for me and you're just kind of sitting there watching all of the trees go by so anyway so what part of your knee is bothering you the most is it the inside the outside [patient] it hurts on the outside but it also feels like it wo n't hold my weight [doctor] okay so it feels like it's gon na buckle [patient] hmmm yes [doctor] okay alright and are you able to bend it [patient] i was immediately after the injury but not really now [doctor] okay and how about straightening it are you able to straighten it at all [patient] somewhat but it really hurts when i try to straighten all the way [doctor] okay alright now do you have any numbing or tingling in your toes [patient] no [doctor] okay and can you feel your toes okay [patient] i think so [doctor] okay alright now are you a pretty active person you said you were skiing do you do what kind of other activities do you do [patient] i chase my two four -year-old [doctor] okay do you have twins [patient] i do [doctor] nice that's great [patient] yeah [doctor] so okay and what's your support like at home who is who is able to help out are you still doing that kind of hobbling around on crutches or [patient] yeah now my husband is home with me but he also works a job where he is gone quite a bit so it's just me and the kids [doctor] okay alright and did the ski patrol give you crutches i i see you have them here with you okay alright great and are you otherwise generally healthy [patient] yes [doctor] okay and no high blood pressure diabetes anything like that [patient] mm-hmm [doctor] no okay alright and well i i wan na go ahead let me just do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay alright so on your heart exam your heart sounds in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation and remind me what knee did you injure again [patient] my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay so on your right knee examination i do appreciate some edema and an effusion over the right knee does it hurt when i press [patient] yes [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right lateral knee there is decreased flexion and extension there is a positive lachman sign there is a palpable palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is no leg edema in the ankle okay well let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and you know my plan for you so you know i know that you had the x-ray done of your of your right knee that did n't show any bony abnormality but i i'm concerned that you have ruptured your your acl or your anterior cruciate ligament that's like a major ligament that helps connect and helps your knee move back and forth so i wan na go ahead and order a knee mri just so that we can get a a a good look and just you know confirm that physical exam okay now some people can have a normal physical exam and their acl can still be torn but you do have a lot of pain on the lateral aspect of your knee so i wan na make sure if there make sure that there is not any other structures that have been damaged by this accident okay i wan na go ahead and you know are you what are you taking for the pain [patient] ibuprofen [doctor] is that helping [patient] somewhat yes [doctor] okay alright do you want something stronger [patient] no i'm okay [doctor] alright so let's just continue with ibuprofen you can take you know six hundred to eight hundred milligrams every eight hours as needed i wan na go ahead and put you in a brace that's gon na help your knee feel a bit more supported okay and let's go ahead and i'm hoping that we can get this mri done in you know the next couple days and then we can have a conversation about what needs to be done now you said that you are are are you know obviously a very active active mom any other exercise or anything else that that i should be aware of that you do just wondering in terms of which kind of graft we would use to fix this with your with your acl being injured [patient] hmmm no i not i i would like to get back to the running but currently not that active [doctor] okay alright alright do you have any questions about anything [patient] i think you've explained it well [doctor] okay alright so i'll see you again soon okay [patient] okay thank you [doctor] alright take care bye",
           "summary":"The patient, Michelle, injured her knee while skiing in Vermont last weekend. She fell and her knee popped, and has been experiencing pain and difficulty with movement since then. The doctor examines her knee and notes edema, an effusion, decreased flexion and extension, and a positive lachman sign. Based on these findings, the doctor orders a knee MRI to confirm the diagnosis of an ACL tear. The doctor also recommends taking ibuprofen for pain relief and wearing a brace to support the knee. The doctor explains that surgery may be required to repair the ACL, and discusses different graft options. The patient is not currently very active, but hopes to get back to running in the future",

you've had for a few weeks now [patient] yeah it was i was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know i was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just has n't been going away [doctor] okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before [patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so [doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not [patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it [doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go [patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain [doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also [patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so [doctor] okay [patient] of course [doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that [patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it [doctor] okay and does that seem to help or [patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit [doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and [patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift [doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then [patient] yeah [doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or [patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of [doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven .\nEight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan [patient] no that sounds good [doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay [patient] sounds great [doctor] okay thanks [patient] thanks [doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or [patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but [doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that [patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good",

           "source":"[doctor] hey betty how are you doing [patient] i'm doing okay i just been really frustrated because with my asthma and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all [patient] hmmm hmmm [doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that [patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me [doctor] okay [patient] so i do n't try to go there often [doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam [patient] okay",

kind of on the inside [patient] yeah more on the it's more on the outside of my hips [doctor] and did you fall down or did you just kind of cut catch yourself [patient] no i fell [doctor] okay and were you able to get up afterwards or somebody helped you up [patient] i was but it was very sore and then started swelling and quite a bit of pain so it's hard to walk [doctor] sure have you tried anything for pain or the swelling or anything like that [patient] ibuprofen some ice and elevation [doctor] okay has that helped much or not really [patient] a little bit [doctor] okay and any pain above your ankle does it hurt on your on your calf or your lower leg at all or knee at all [patient] no it's mostly just the outside of my ankle [doctor] okay got it and no bleeding or i'm sure it's a little swollen probably [patient] yeah it's swollen but no bleeding [doctor] well i'll have you take off your shoes in a second we'll examine you in a second but since you're here and i wanted to talk about some of your other things that you know we have n't i have n't seen you in a year so let's talk about your history of diabetes as well are you taking the metformin how's your blood sugars been how how're you managing that any issues with that [patient] no they've been pretty stable [doctor] okay [patient] so with my diet [doctor] good [patient] so [doctor] you're checking your sugars regularly as well [patient] yes [doctor] okay your hemoglobin a1c last time i looked at epic was about six .\nEight which is really good so i think you're doing a great job we had talked about you know cutting off the sweets and sugars and stuff like that and exercising so it sounds like you're you're you're doing a pretty good job with that have you seen the ophthalmologist recently for your eye exam for your diabetes checkup or no [patient] i am due for one of those in the next couple of weeks [doctor] okay alright so we'll so you do you already have an appointment or do you need to make an appointment for that [patient] i have an appointment [doctor] perfect excellent okay and how is your blood pressure been i know we watching it your blood pressure today looks pretty good it's about one seventy over i'm sorry one twenty over seventy you're taking norvasc any issues with that any do you need any refills or anything [patient] i need a refill on that yes [doctor] okay alright well let me examine you here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my match exam and i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put that into my record okay so your neck exam is fine there is no bruits your lungs are clear your heart exam is normal you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is i think you probably have an ankle sprain but i would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone and i'm sometimes worried about a fracture so i'm gon na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you [patient] that's a great plan i need to get back to exercising so [doctor] okay [patient] thank you [doctor] perfect and for the diabetes keep the eye appointment that you already have you know continue with the metformin i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check some baseline labs as well since it's been a while since we checked them and then once if you have any issues or you know give me a call we can get you into the office and for the high blood pressure i'll go ahead and refill the norvasc today you're doing a great job with that it sounds like continue to monitor that if something changes certainly call me we can get you in sooner okay [patient] thank you [doctor] sounds good sounds good good great seeing you thanks stephanie [patient] thank you",

           "source":"[doctor] hey gregory good to see you today so take a look at my notes and i see that you're here you've had a nonhealing foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks [patient] okay sounds great thanks document [doctor] alright great",

           "summary":"Dr. Isabella met new patient, Jose James, who was suffering from constant pain in his left shoulder and elbow due to a fall on ice five months prior. The pain aggravated while performing gym routine and lifting weights of more than 15 or 20 pounds had become impossible. Although Mr. James had ceased exercise and applied ice to ease the pain, he experienced no numbness or tingling. Upon examination, Dr. Isabella diagnosed Mr. James with impingement syndrome of the left shoulder, noting this type of issue is common after a fall. She suggested starting with physical therapy and if there was no improvement, she recommended a cortisone injection. Mr. James agreed to start with the physical therapy and would consider the injection if required",

           "source":"When you think of a laboratory you wouldn't usually think of cheering crowds or actors in costumes.\nYou might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight.\nBut shakespeare's globe on london's bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers.\nEverything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics the globe's site beside the river thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse.\nBuilding this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the sam wanamaker playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself.\nFarah karim-cooper, one of the globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources.\nThe design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of \"informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence\".\nBut this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating \"authenticity\", says dr karim-cooper.\nThe buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences.\n\"we're not interested in re-enactment,\" she says.\nBut she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice.\nLike how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre?\nIt was something that happened regularly in shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor globe to an indoor playhouse such as the blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the river thames.\nIt must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub.\nThe globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight.\nThe globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light.\nAnd in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles.\nLight and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era.\n\"darkness was a terrifying presence,\" says dr karim-cooper.\n\"darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick.\nIt was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.\"\nShe says that if elizabethans or jacobeans travelled in time to modern london \"their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light\".\nAnother big difference is that shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.\nThe modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.\nIn the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen.\nThe really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.\nAnd one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.\n\"it was a very social occasion,\" says dr karim-cooper, describing the shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.\n\"contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,\" she says.\nPutting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.\nFor instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says dr karim-cooper.\nModern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue.\nWhen the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.\nThere are other big changes between a modern and shakespearean theatre visit.\nIt would have smelled very different, says dr karim-cooper.\nThere would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.\nAnother sensory difference would have been the \"soundscape\", she says.\nIt would have been a much softer sound, as elizabethan london didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.\n\"in terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,\" she says.\n\"there are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming.\nThey never heard a plane taking off.\"\nThe language would have sounded unusual too.\nThe accent of the time would have meant words such as \"move\" and \"love\" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.\nAnd the globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.\nThe role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.\n\"there is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do.\nIt wouldn't work,\" says dr karim-cooper.\nInstead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions.\nThey pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.\n\"we want to get beyond wikipedia,\" she says.\nShe is co-editor of moving shakespeare indoors, a collection of essays on indoor jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the globe's work.\nThere is a postgraduate degree course in shakespeare studies with king's college, london.\nThere are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers.\nEvery year there is a landmark schools production, the playing shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for london pupils.\nIt's been a huge success, with many  coming to see shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before.\nDr karim-cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory.\n\"we want to become a research hub.\nWe want students to be here.\"\nThe \"unique blend\" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the \"literary rigour\".\n\"we don't separate the practical from the academic.\"",
           "summary":"Shakespeare's Globe in London uses its in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisors to ensure everything from physical design to performances is historically accurate, yet engaging for modern audiences. The Globe has two theatres, including the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, an indoor Jacobean theatre, which was designed based on architectural evidence and historical records. The theatre seeks to replicate the close, warm atmosphere of performances of Shakespeare's day. The team note that the ways in which plays were performed would have vastly differed from today\u2019s practice. Original soliloquies, for instance, would have been a conversation with the audience, highlight the scholars, who are also involved in researching detailed questions raised by the play's actors and directors in order to improve performances.",

regularly as well [patient] yes [doctor] okay your hemoglobin a1c last time i looked at epic was about six .\nEight which is really good so i think you're doing a great job we had talked about you know cutting off the sweets and sugars and stuff like that and exercising so it sounds like you're you're you're doing a pretty good job with that have you seen the ophthalmologist recently for your eye exam for your diabetes checkup or no [patient] i am due for one of those in the next couple of weeks [doctor] okay alright so we'll so you do you already have an appointment or do you need to make an appointment for that [patient] i have an appointment [doctor] perfect excellent okay and how is your blood pressure been i know we watching it your blood pressure today looks pretty good it's about

let me examine you here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my match exam and i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put that into my record okay so your neck exam is fine there is no bruits your lungs are clear your heart exam is normal you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is i think you probably have an ankle sprain but i would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone and i'm sometimes worried about a fracture so i'm gon na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you [patient] that's a great plan i need to get back to exercising so [doctor] okay [patient] thank you [doctor] perfect and for the diabetes keep the eye appointment that you already have you know continue with the metformin i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check some baseline labs as well since it's been a while since we checked them and then once if you have any issues or you know give me a call we can get you into the office and for the high blood pressure i'll go ahead and refill the norvasc today you're doing a great job with that it sounds like continue to monitor that if something changes certainly call me we can get you in sooner okay [patient] thank you [doctor] sounds good sounds good good great seeing you thanks stephanie [patient] thank you",

were you able to get up afterwards or somebody helped you up [patient] i was but it was very sore and then started swelling and quite a bit of pain so it's hard to walk [doctor] sure have you tried anything for pain or the swelling or anything like that [patient] ibuprofen some ice and elevation [doctor] okay has that helped much or not really [patient] a little bit [doctor] okay and any pain above your ankle does it hurt on your on your calf or your lower leg at all or knee at all [patient] no it's mostly just the outside of my ankle [doctor] okay got it and no bleeding or i'm sure it's a little swollen probably [patient] yeah it's swollen but no bleeding [doctor] well i'll have you take off your shoes in a second we'll examine you in a second but since you're here and i wanted to talk about some of your other things that you know we have n't i have n't seen you in a year so let's talk about your history of diabetes as well are you taking the metformin how's your blood sugars been how how're you managing that any issues with that [patient] no they've been pretty stable [doctor] okay [patient] so with my diet [doctor] good [patient] so [doctor] you're checking your sugars regularly as well [patient] yes [doctor] okay your hemoglobin a1c last time i looked at epic was about six .\nEight which is really good so i think you're doing a great job we had talked about you know cutting off the sweets and sugars and stuff like that and exercising so it sounds like you're you're you're doing a pretty good job with that have you seen the ophthalmologist recently for your eye exam for your diabetes checkup or no [patient] i am due for one of those in the next couple of weeks [doctor] okay alright so we'll so you do you already have an appointment or do you need to make an appointment for that [patient] i have an appointment [doctor] perfect excellent okay and how is your blood pressure been i know we watching it your blood pressure today looks pretty good it's about one seventy over i'm sorry one twenty over seventy you're taking norvasc any issues with that any do you need any refills or anything [patient] i need a refill on that yes [doctor] okay alright well let me examine you here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my match exam and i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put that into my record okay so your neck exam is fine there is no bruits your lungs are clear your heart exam is normal you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is i think you probably have an ankle sprain but i would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone and i'm sometimes worried about a fracture so i'm gon na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you [patient] that's a great plan i need to get back to exercising so [doctor] okay [patient] thank you [doctor] perfect and for the diabetes keep the eye appointment that you already have you know continue with the metformin i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check some baseline labs as well since it's been a while since we checked them and then once if you have any issues or you know give me a call we can get you into the office and for the high blood pressure i'll go ahead and refill the norvasc today you're doing a great job with that it sounds like continue to monitor that if something changes certainly call me we can get you in sooner okay [patient] thank you [doctor] sounds good sounds good good great seeing you thanks stephanie [patient] thank you",

did a jump and kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since [doctor] okay so that was about five days ago then [patient] yeah yeah that was last weekend [doctor] last weekend okay now which knee is it [patient] it's my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened [patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards [doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance [patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore [doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before [patient] no that was the first time [doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake [patient] lake martin [doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier [patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can [doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day [patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway [doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked [patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days [doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing [patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it [doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all [patient] no just the swelling and the pain [doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain [patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day [doctor] okay and [patient] putting a cold pack on it [doctor] okay and has that helped at all [patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though [doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here [patient] i had my tonsils out [doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press [patient] yeah that's sore [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt [patient] yeah do n't do that anymore [doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that [patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan [doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions [patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me [doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye [patient] thank you",

sandra who injured her knee cold dancing so that would immediately came up to mine but let's try skiing so i was skiing in vermont last weekend and i caught my ski when i was coming off the lift and i fell and my knee popped and it's hurt ever since [doctor] okay and were you able to ski down the hill or did you have to be taken down by the ski patrol [patient] i had to be taken down by the ski patrol i was unable to bear weight [doctor] okay is n't that slightly terrifying they had to do the same thing for me and you're just kind of sitting there watching all of the trees go by so anyway so what part of your knee is bothering you the most is it the inside the outside [patient] it hurts on the outside but it also feels like it wo n't hold my weight [doctor] okay so it feels like it's gon na buckle [patient] hmmm yes [doctor] okay alright and are you able to bend it [patient] i was immediately after the injury but not really now [doctor] okay and how about straightening it are you able to straighten it at all [patient] somewhat but it really hurts when i try to straighten all the way [doctor] okay alright now do you have any numbing or tingling in your toes [patient] no [doctor] okay and can you feel your toes okay [patient] i think so [doctor] okay alright now are you a pretty active person you said you were skiing do you do what kind of other activities do you do [patient] i chase my two four -year-old [doctor] okay do you have twins [patient] i do [doctor] nice that's great [patient] yeah [doctor] so okay and what's your support like at home who is who is able to help out are you still doing that kind of hobbling around on crutches or [patient] yeah now my husband is home with me but he also works a job where he is gone quite a bit so it's just me and the kids [doctor] okay alright and did the ski patrol give you crutches i i see you have them here with you okay alright great and are you otherwise generally healthy [patient] yes [doctor] okay and no high blood pressure diabetes anything like that [patient] mm-hmm [doctor] no okay alright and well i i wan na go ahead let me just do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay alright so on your heart exam your heart sounds in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation and remind me what knee did you injure again [patient] my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay so on your right knee examination i do appreciate some edema and an effusion over the right knee does it hurt when i press [patient] yes [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right lateral knee there is decreased flexion and extension there is a positive lachman sign there is a palpable palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is no leg edema in the ankle okay well let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and you know my plan for you so you know i know that you had the x-ray done of your of your right knee that did n't show any bony abnormality but i i'm concerned that you have ruptured your your acl or your anterior cruciate ligament that's like a major ligament that helps connect and helps your knee move back and forth so i wan na go ahead and order a knee mri just so that we can get a a a good look and just you know confirm that physical exam okay now some people can have a normal physical exam and their acl can still be torn but you do have a lot of pain on the lateral aspect of your knee so i wan na make sure if there make sure that there is not any other structures that have been damaged by this accident okay i wan na go ahead and you know are you what are you taking for the pain [patient] ibuprofen [doctor] is that helping [patient] somewhat yes [doctor] okay alright do you want something stronger [patient] no i'm okay [doctor] alright so let's just continue with ibuprofen you can take you know six hundred to eight hundred milligrams every eight hours as needed i wan na go ahead and put you in a brace that's gon na help your knee feel a bit more supported okay and let's go ahead and i'm hoping that we can get this mri done in you know the next couple days and then we can have a conversation about what needs to be done now you said that you are are are you know obviously a very active active mom any other exercise or anything else that that i should be aware of that you do just wondering in terms of which kind of graft we would use to fix this with your with your acl being injured [patient] hmmm no i not i i would like to get back to the running but currently not that active [doctor] okay alright alright do you have any questions about anything [patient] i think you've explained it well [doctor] okay alright so i'll see you again soon okay [patient] okay thank you [doctor] alright take care bye",
           "summary":"A patient, Michelle, went to see a doctor because she injured her knee while skiing. She has pain and swelling on the outside of her knee and difficulty bending or straightening it. The doctor suspects that Michelle may have torn her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and orders an MRI to confirm the diagnosis. The doctor also recommends that Michelle wear a brace to support her knee and suggests taking ibuprofen for pain relief. The doctor mentions that if the MRI confirms an ACL tear, they will discuss options for repairing the ligament, possibly using a graft from another part of Michelle's body.",

           "summary":"The document is a narration of the author's experience at a football practice. During his first spring practice as a quarterback, the author ended up dehydrated and almost passed out but was told by the coach to complete the sprints. At the end of the day, he was instructed to lead a huddle and call a play. However, due to lack of knowledge, he made a mistake by throwing the ball on a run play, which resulted in his coach's disappointment and ridicule from his teammates. The author decided to quit practicing and expressed his interest in playing guitar and filming. His coach then offered him an opportunity to film their football games in the future and proposed connecting him with a friend in South Carolina for a potential scholarship in filming games.",

           "source":"[doctor] hey betty how are you doing [patient] i'm doing okay i just been really frustrated because with my asthma and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all [patient] hmmm hmmm [doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that [patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me [doctor] okay [patient] so i do n't try to go there often [doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam [patient] okay",
           "summary":"The patient, Betty, is experiencing frequent asthma symptoms, including coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. The symptoms are triggered by colds, cat exposure, and sometimes occur during outdoor activities. She uses an albuterol inhaler almost daily and occasionally wakes up at night due to difficulty breathing. She has had numerous urgent care and emergency department visits in the past year, often requiring prednisone. The patient's last asthma exacerbation was about a month ago. She enjoys hiking and is eager to start hiking again once her symptoms improve. Betty does not smoke, vape, or use marijuana. She sometimes goes to bars with friends, but the smoke irritates her.",

you've had for a few weeks now [patient] yeah it was i was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know i was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just has n't been going away [doctor] okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before [patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so [doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not [patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it [doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go [patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain [doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also [patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so [doctor] okay [patient] of course [doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that [patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it [doctor] okay and does that seem to help or [patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit [doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and [patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift [doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then [patient] yeah [doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or [patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of [doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven .\nEight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan [patient] no that sounds good [doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay [patient] sounds great [doctor] okay thanks [patient] thanks [doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or [patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but [doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that [patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good",

They saw their primary care physician (PCP) and were referred to a doctor for evaluation. The patient reports that they had a new pair of shoes that caused the problem, and they saw a podiatrist a few years ago but were unable to find another one. The patient also has diabetes and their last HbA1c was a little over 8. The doctor performs a physical exam and finds that there is a 1x2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot, with some yellow slough present and minimal granulation tissue.",

           "source":"[doctor] hey hi bobby how are you doing [patient] i'm doing good how are you [doctor] i'm doing fine so i understand you're here having some left or some right shoulder pain that you've had for a few weeks now [patient] yeah it was i was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know i was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just has n't been going away [doctor] okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before [patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so [doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not [patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it [doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go [patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain [doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also [patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so [doctor] okay [patient] of course [doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that [patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it [doctor] okay and does that seem to help or [patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit [doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and [patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift [doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then [patient] yeah [doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or [patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of [doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven .\nEight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan [patient] no that sounds good [doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay [patient] sounds great [doctor] okay thanks [patient] thanks [doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or [patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but [doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that [patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good",
           "summary":"The patient, Bobby, visited the doctor with repeated pain in his right shoulder which he injured during some work in his yard. The pain was persistent and particularly noticeable when he moved his arm. Although he doesn't face any restrictions in moving his arm, the outside area of the shoulder is tender when he raises his arm. The doctor examined Bobby and found that his shoulder's active and passive range of motion were limited with some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus. The shoulder x-ray showed no fracture. The doctor judged his symptoms to likely be due to rotator cuff tendinopathy and has recommended an MRI to confirm, along with physical therapy for six to eight weeks.",

           "source":"[doctor] hey hi bobby how are you doing [patient] i'm doing good how are you [doctor] i'm doing fine so i understand you're here having some left or some right shoulder pain that you've had for a few weeks now [patient] yeah it was i was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know i was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just has n't been going away [doctor] okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before [patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so [doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not [patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it [doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go [patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain [doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also [patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so [doctor] okay [patient] of course [doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that [patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it [doctor] okay and does that seem to help or [patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit [doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and [patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift [doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then [patient] yeah [doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or [patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of [doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven .\nEight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan [patient] no that sounds good [doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay [patient] sounds great [doctor] okay thanks [patient] thanks [doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or [patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but [doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that [patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good",
           "summary":"The document discusses a patient who is experiencing ongoing shoulder pain and discomfort. The patient, Bobby, has had issues with his right shoulder in the past and has been experiencing pain on the outside of the shoulder, rather than the rotator cuff. The patient is able to move his arm without restriction, but feels pain when he raises it. The pain is intermittent and does not occur at night. The patient has been taking Advil and icing the shoulder to alleviate some of the discomfort. The doctor conducts a physical exam and finds limited active and passive range of motion in the shoulder, as well as tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus.",

He was admitted to the ER due to high blood sugar levels, which were caused by not monitoring his diet while his mother was in the hospital. Since then, he has been following his diet closely and feels better. His kidney transplant is doing well, and he has been diligent with his immunotherapy medication. He has been managing his depression with meditation and finds it helpful. A physical exam revealed slight edema in his lower extremities, and his blood sugar level was 162 at the time of the visit.",

sandra who injured her knee cold dancing so that would immediately came up to mine but let's try skiing so i was skiing in vermont last weekend and i caught my ski when i was coming off the lift and i fell and my knee popped and it's hurt ever since [doctor] okay and were you able to ski down the hill or did you have to be taken down by the ski patrol [patient] i had to be taken down by the ski patrol i was unable to bear weight [doctor] okay is n't that slightly terrifying they had to do the same thing for me and you're just kind of sitting there watching all of the trees go by so anyway so what part of your knee is bothering you the most is it the inside the outside [patient] it hurts on the outside but it also feels like it wo n't hold my weight [doctor] okay so it feels like it's gon na buckle [patient] hmmm yes [doctor] okay alright and are you able to bend it [patient] i was immediately after the injury but not really now [doctor] okay and how about straightening it are you able to straighten it at all [patient] somewhat but it really hurts when i try to straighten all the way [doctor] okay alright now do you have any numbing or tingling in your toes [patient] no [doctor] okay and can you feel your toes okay [patient] i think so [doctor] okay alright now are you a pretty active person you said you were skiing do you do what kind of other activities do you do [patient] i chase my two four -year-old [doctor] okay do you have twins [patient] i do [doctor] nice that's great [patient] yeah [doctor] so okay and what's your support like at home who is who is able to help out are you still doing that kind of hobbling around on crutches or [patient] yeah now my husband is home with me but he also works a job where he is gone quite a bit so it's just me and the kids [doctor] okay alright and did the ski patrol give you crutches i i see you have them here with you okay alright great and are you otherwise generally healthy [patient] yes [doctor] okay and no high blood pressure diabetes anything like that [patient] mm-hmm [doctor] no okay alright and well i i wan na go ahead let me just do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay alright so on your heart exam your heart sounds in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation and remind me what knee did you injure again [patient] my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay so on your right knee examination i do appreciate some edema and an effusion over the right knee does it hurt when i press [patient] yes [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right lateral knee there is decreased flexion and extension there is a positive lachman sign there is a palpable palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is no leg edema in the ankle okay well let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and you know my plan for you so you know i know that you had the x-ray done of your of your right knee that did n't show any bony abnormality but i i'm concerned that you have ruptured your your acl or your anterior cruciate ligament that's like a major ligament that helps connect and helps your knee move back and forth so i wan na go ahead and order a knee mri just so that we can get a a a good look and just you know confirm that physical exam okay now some people can have a normal physical exam and their acl can still be torn but you do have a lot of pain on the lateral aspect of your knee so i wan na make sure if there make sure that there is not any other structures that have been damaged by this accident okay i wan na go ahead and you know are you what are you taking for the pain [patient] ibuprofen [doctor] is that helping [patient] somewhat yes [doctor] okay alright do you want something stronger [patient] no i'm okay [doctor] alright so let's just continue with ibuprofen you can take you know six hundred to eight hundred milligrams every eight hours as needed i wan na go ahead and put you in a brace that's gon na help your knee feel a bit more supported okay and let's go ahead and i'm hoping that we can get this mri done in you know the next couple days and then we can have a conversation about what needs to be done now you said that you are are are you know obviously a very active active mom any other exercise or anything else that that i should be aware of that you do just wondering in terms of which kind of graft we would use to fix this with your with your acl being injured [patient] hmmm no i not i i would like to get back to the running but currently not that active [doctor] okay alright alright do you have any questions about anything [patient] i think you've explained it well [doctor] okay alright so i'll see you again soon okay [patient] okay thank you [doctor] alright take care bye",
           "summary":"The patient, Michelle, injured her right knee during a ski accident. She reported to the doctor her difficulty in sustaining weight on the knee and difficulty in bending and straightening it fully due to extreme pain. The doctor conducted a physical examination and noted swelling, and a positive lachman sign, indicating potential ligament damage. The doctor suspects a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (acl) despite there being no bony abnormality in the x-ray. The doctor recommends an MRI to confirm this and to check for other potential injuries. Currently, the patient is managing pain with Ibuprofen. The doctor also advises a knee brace for added support and schedules follow up after the MRI.",

tell dax about you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] cheryl is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension , who presents today with back pain .\nCheryl , what happened to your back ?\n[patient] so i've been walking a lot lately .\nI've been walking to ... 30 minutes to an hour or so a day .\nAnd all of a sudden , um , when i was walking , my , um , back just kind of seized up on me .\nAnd i do n't really know what it was .\nMaybe i was going a little bit faster .\nBut it just all kind of clenched .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo you felt like , maybe like a spasm or something like that ?\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how many days ago was that ?\n[patient] that was about six days ago now .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd what have you taken for the pain ?\n[patient] i've been taking ibuprofen .\nUm , and then i've been putting some heat on it .\nBut it's still pretty stiff .\n[doctor] okay .\nAll right .\nUm , and did you have any trauma before that happened ?\nWere you doing anything strenuous like crossfit or lifting boxes or anything like that before you went for , for the walk ?\n[patient] i have been lifting more , um , probably around three times a week .\nSo i do n't know if it was because i was doing deadlifts that day and then walked .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] um , maybe i was using my back more than my legs .\n[doctor] okay .\nAll right .\nAnd was it any particular area in your back ?\nWas it the lower back ?\n[patient] yeah , it was .\n[doctor] okay .\nOn one side versus the other ?\n[patient] um , kind of both equally .\n[doctor] okay .\nAll right .\nAnd any numbing or tingling in your legs or your feet ?\n[patient] no , i have n't felt anything like that .\n[doctor] okay .\nAny weakness in your lower extremities ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay .\nAll right .\nAnd then in terms of your blood pressure , how are you doing ?\n[patient] so i got that cuff that you suggested the ... our ... the last visit , and i've been doing readings at home .\nAnd that's been looking great , too .\nI've been watching my diet .\nAgain , my boyfriend's been great and dieting with me so i do n't have to do it alone .\nAnd everything's been good .\n[doctor] okay .\nExcellent .\nAnd you're taking the lisinopril ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay .\nWonderful .\nOkay .\nSo i know you did a review of systems sheet with the nurse , and i know you endorse , you know , this back pain .\nUm , do you have any other symptoms ?\nFever , chills , congestion , cough , chest pain , shortness of breath ?\n[patient] i have a little bit of nasal congestion , but that's just from my seasonal allergies .\n[doctor] okay .\nAll right .\nWell , let's go ahead .\nI want to do a quick physical exam on you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] okay ?\nHey , dragon , show me the vital signs .\nSo good- you know , here in the office , your vital signs look great .\nYour blood pressure's really well controlled , which is good .\nSo that's a good job .\nSo i'm going to take a listen to your heart and lungs .\nI'm going to examine your back , and i'm going to let you know what i find .\nOkay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] okay .\nAll right .\nSo on physical examination , you know , everything looks good .\nYou know , on your heart exam , i do hear that slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur , but you've had that before .\nThat seems stable to me .\nOn your back exam , you do have some pain to palpation on the right lateral aspect of your lumbar spine , and you do have pain with flexion and extension as well , and you have a negative straight leg raise .\nSo what does that mean ?\nSo we're going to go over that .\nOkay ?\nLet's ... let me look at some of your results , though , first .\nOkay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] we did an x-ray before you saw me , so let's look at that .\nHey , dragon , show me the back x-ray .\nSo looking here at this x-ray of the lumbar spine , everything looks good .\nThere's good boney alignment .\nThere's no obvious fracture , you know , which is not surprising based on your history .\nOkay ?\n[patient] hmm .\n[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the labs .\nAnd your labs that we did before you came in all look great .\nThere's no elevated white blood cell count .\nThere's no signs of infection .\nAgain , those are all really good .\nOkay ?\nSo let me go over with you about my assessment and my plan for you .\nSo for your first problem , this back pain , i think you have a lumbar strain , and , you know , that might've happened , you know , lifting something or exercising .\nAnd so what i want to do is prescribe meloxicam , 15 milligrams once a day .\nUh , i want you ... you can ice the area , and you can also apply heat sometimes as well .\nUm , you know , i'm going to refer you to physical therapy just to do some strengthening exercises of your back , um , because i do want you to continue to be able to work out and exercise .\nOkay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and for your last problem , your high blood pressure , again , everything looks great here .\nUm , you know , i think you're doing a really good job with that as well .\nI want you to continue on the lisinopril , 10 milligrams a day .\nAnd then , uh , let me know if you notice any increases in your blood pressure readings .\nOkay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] do you need a refill of the lisinopril ?\n[patient] yes , i do , actually .\n[doctor] okay .\nHey , dragon ?\nOrder lisinopril 10 milligrams po daily .\nOkay .\nUh , so the nurse will be in soon , and she'll get you checked out .\nOkay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right .\nHey , dragon ?\nFinalize the note .",

The patient had experienced similar back pain about three years ago, but it had resolved itself within a day.

           "source":"[doctor] hey kyle it's nice to see you today can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in [patient] yeah i went to see my pcp for a cough which they diagnosed as bronchitis but then they did that chest x-ray to make sure i did n't have pneumonia and they found this lung nodule i went for a cat scan that confirmed it and they referred me here to you i'm really nervous document [doctor] okay well first of all i'm i'm sorry that you're nervous and what we're gon na do is we're gon na partner together okay and i'm gon na be right by your side the whole time to hopefully make you a little less nervous and and recognize the fact that we're you're gon na have a big support team around you okay [patient] okay [doctor] so let's talk a little bit about how long you've had that cough before you went to see your doctor [patient] i you know off and on i've had it for about three months i first noticed it when i was loading some pay i have horses and i i bought you know four hundred bills a day and when i spent a day loading it and then it's i just started coughing a lot more i think around that time and after that i i i just got a cold so that's what sent me to my pcp now i i i do exercise i i do a lot of biking and i typically do n't get sick and my cough has gone away [doctor] okay that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking i love to bike myself i've got a track seventy one hundred hybrid have you been on the the new trails they opened it was the old the old rail the old rail road right away they've opened that up it's like sixty miles of trails [patient] i love that that road i just i i do n't like riding on the road so i prefer to do those rails the trails type [doctor] yeah [patient] and it's just so phenomenal i do that a lot [doctor] yeah i love riding over there way we will we will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride [patient] absolutely i'd love it [doctor] that'd be great so i see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time and and and what do you do to to take care of your ra [patient] yeah it's it's it's fair you know arthritis never really goes away but i take methotrexate [doctor] okay [patient] i think it's seven and a half milligrams every week and as long as i'm keeping active my joints feel okay and if i do have any problems it's it's mostly with my hands but i have n't had any recent flares so i'm okay right now [doctor] okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking [patient] i stopped smoking probably about seven years ago [doctor] okay [patient] and i was young and should have stopped the way before that my kids were on me all the time but you know i i got a new start and finally was able to stop and i felt better after stopping [doctor] okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that [patient] no not at all [doctor] okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies [patient] no lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer but she is doing well now [doctor] okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that [patient] no no not not anything that i'm aware of [doctor] okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process [patient] no i do n't think so i think i'll be okay i'm scared [doctor] i i know you're scared but we'll be right here with you the whole way [patient] okay [doctor] alright we'll get some paperwork and i'll see you again in a few minutes [patient] okay thank you",
           "summary":"Kyle visited his doctor due to a persistent cough that had lasted for three months. A chest X-ray revealed a lung nodule, confirmed by a CT scan. He has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, controlled with methotrexate, and quit smoking seven years ago. His physical exam was normal, and his chest CT showed a solitary two-centimeter nodule in the right upper lobe, appearing smooth with no emphysematous disease. The doctor ordered pulmonary function tests and a PET CT to assess the nodule's metabolic activity. He recommended surgical removal of the nodule via video-assisted thoracoscopy, with a one-night hospital stay. The doctor advised Kyle to continue follow-up with his rheumatologist for his rheumatoid arthritis.",

           "source":"[doctor] hey betty how are you doing [patient] i'm doing okay i just been really frustrated because with my asthma and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all [patient] hmmm hmmm [doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that [patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me [doctor] okay [patient] so i do n't try to go there often [doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam [patient] okay",

           "source":"[doctor] hey matthew i see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your pcp sent you over to see me how're you doing today [patient] pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse [doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there [patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time [doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version [patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden [doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at [patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month [doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes [patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here [doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me [patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg [doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life [patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten [doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better [patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down [doctor] okay [patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today [doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs [patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well [doctor] that's okay [patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day [doctor] absolutely [patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them [doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here [patient] no it's right here [doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there [patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks [doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please [patient] okay that's it that's all i got [doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan [patient] sure sounds good [doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you",
           "summary":"The patient, Matthew, is a 35-year-old male who has been experiencing lower back pain and leg pain for about a month. The pain is located in the lower back and radiates down the left leg, and is described as an electric shock sensation.

patrol i was unable to bear weight [doctor] okay is n't that slightly terrifying they had to do the same thing for me and you're just kind of sitting there watching all of the trees go by so anyway so what part of your knee is bothering you the most is it the inside the outside [patient] it hurts on the outside but it also feels like it wo n't hold my weight [doctor] okay so it feels like it's gon na buckle [patient] hmmm yes [doctor] okay alright and are you able to bend it [patient] i was immediately after the injury but not really now [doctor] okay and how about straightening it are you able to straighten it at all [patient] somewhat but it really hurts when i try to straighten all the way [doctor] okay alright now do you have any numbing or tingling in your toes [patient] no [doctor] okay and can you feel your toes okay [patient] i think so [doctor] okay alright now are you a pretty active person you said you were skiing do you do what kind of other activities do you do [patient] i chase my two four -year-old [doctor] okay do you have twins [patient] i do [doctor] nice that's great [patient] yeah [doctor] so okay and what's your support like at home who is who is able to help out are you still doing that kind of hobbling around on crutches or [patient] yeah now my husband is home with me but he also works a job where he is gone quite a bit so it's just me and the kids

blood pressure diabetes anything like that [patient] mm-hmm [doctor] no okay alright and well i i wan na go ahead let me just do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay alright so on your heart exam your heart sounds in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation and remind me what knee did you injure again [patient] my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay so on your right knee examination i do appreciate some edema and an effusion over the right knee does it hurt when i press [patient] yes [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right lateral knee there is decreased flexion and extension there is a positive lachman sign there is a palpable palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is no leg edema in the ankle okay well let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and you know my plan for you so you know i know that you had the x-ray done of your of your right knee that did n't show any bony abnormality but i i'm concerned that you have ruptured your your acl or your anterior cruciate ligament that's like a major ligament that helps connect and helps your knee move back and forth so i wan na go ahead and order a knee mri just so that we can get a a a good look and just you know confirm that physical exam okay now some people can have a normal physical exam and their acl can still be torn but you do have a lot of pain on the lateral aspect of your knee so i wan na make sure if there make sure that there is not any other structures that have been damaged by this accident okay i wan na go ahead and you know are you what are you taking for the pain [patient] ibuprofen [doctor] is that helping [patient] somewhat yes [doctor] okay alright do you want something stronger [patient] no i'm okay [doctor] alright so let's just continue with ibuprofen you can take you know six hundred to eight hundred milligrams every eight hours as needed i wan na go ahead and put you in a brace that's gon na help your knee feel a bit more supported okay and let's go ahead and i'm hoping that we can get this mri done in you know the next couple days and then we can have a conversation about what needs to be done now you said that you are are are you know obviously a very active active mom any other exercise or anything else that that i should be aware of that you do just wondering in terms of which kind of graft we would use to fix this with your with

           "summary":"A 42-year-old female patient, Ms. James, visited Dr. Cooper after injuring her index finger while skiing. She has taken ibuprofen for relief, but it didn't seem to help. The incident occurred five days ago and she rated her pain seven out of 10. She had not applied icing or used a splint. A closer examination involving an X-ray showed no fractures, but she experienced pain upon the doctor's physical check, particularly when her finger was pushed, pulled, or squeezed. This led the doctor to determine that it was sprained. The doctor decided to apply a splint and prescribe Mobic, a potent anti-inflammatory drug. She was advised to revisit the doctor in two weeks for further evaluation.",

           "source":"[doctor] hey matthew i see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your pcp sent you over to see me how're you doing today [patient] pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse [doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there [patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time [doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version [patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden [doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at [patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month [doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes [patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here [doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me [patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg [doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life [patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten [doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better [patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down [doctor] okay [patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today [doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs [patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well [doctor] that's okay [patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day [doctor] absolutely [patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them [doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here [patient] no it's right here [doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there [patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks [doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please [patient] okay that's it that's all i got [doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan [patient] sure sounds good [doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you",

he started playing basketball and there we do multiple seasons and so we're kinda getting ready for the next season that starts in in april and we were at the courts plan and i went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers i guess he could say and so he he found me while i was going for a lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen [doctor] yeah [patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym [doctor] okay [patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so [doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way [patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys [doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad [patient] yeah yes [doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too [patient] yeah a little bit [doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all [patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid [doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable [patient] yeah [doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches [patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach [doctor] great [patient] starting in april so [doctor] alright well [patient] how long [doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again [patient] okay [doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly [patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out [doctor] yeah i i'm a dog walker as well so alright sorry for the bad news but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do [patient] alright thank you doctor [doctor] alright thanks",

throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks [patient] okay sounds great thanks document [doctor] alright great",
           "summary":"A patient, Gregory, visited a doctor for a nonhealing foot ulcer that had been present for two months. The patient had been to the beach and possibly stepped on something, causing the ulcer. The patient's vital signs were normal, but there was redness, drainage, and swelling around the ulcer. The doctor suspected an infection and ordered an ABI (ankle brachial index) test to determine blood supply to the foot. The doctor also performed a debridement and prescribed clindamycin to treat the infection. The patient was instructed to wear a surgical shoe and return for another appointment in two weeks.",

he started playing basketball and there we do multiple seasons and so we're kinda getting ready for the next season that starts in in april and we were at the courts plan and i went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers i guess he could say and so he he found me while i was going for a lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen [doctor] yeah [patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym [doctor] okay [patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so [doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way [patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys [doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad [patient] yeah yes [doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too [patient] yeah a little bit [doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all [patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid [doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable [patient] yeah [doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches [patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach [doctor] great [patient] starting in april so [doctor] alright well [patient] how long [doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again [patient] okay [doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly [patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out [doctor] yeah i i'm a dog walker as well so alright sorry for the bad news but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do [patient] alright thank you doctor [doctor] alright thanks",

Charles, who have recently moved to the city, shares his issues of catching breath and episodes of watered eyes which he assumes are due to allergies. He currently uses an inhaler prescribed by Urgent Care. No symptoms of nausea, vomiting or any rash were reported. After understanding the symptoms, the doctor physically examines Charles and finds some faint expiratory wheezing, although the rest of the vital signs look good.The doctor then diagnoses Charles with newly diagnosed allergic asthma.",

did a jump and kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since [doctor] okay so that was about five days ago then [patient] yeah yeah that was last weekend [doctor] last weekend okay now which knee is it [patient] it's my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened [patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards [doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance [patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore [doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before [patient] no that was the first time [doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake [patient] lake martin [doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier [patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can [doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day [patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway [doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked [patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days [doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing [patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it [doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all [patient] no just the swelling and the pain [doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain [patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day [doctor] okay and [patient] putting a cold pack on it [doctor] okay and has that helped at all [patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though [doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here [patient] i had my tonsils out [doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press [patient] yeah that's sore [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt [patient] yeah do n't do that anymore [doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that [patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan [doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions [patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me [doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye [patient] thank you",
           "summary":"Kenneth, a patient, experienced knee pain while water skiing over the weekend. He twisted his right knee upon landing from a jump and it swelled afterward. He's never had any knee injuries before. Dr. Kenneth examined him and determined that he has a medial collateral ligament strain. An x-ray was ordered to rule out any bone fractures. Physical therapy and meloxicam were prescribed to address the pain and swelling. The doctor advised Kenneth to rest the knee and avoid skiing further to prevent further injury. They also discussed his well-managed high blood pressure, prescribed lisinopril, and ordered a lipid panel. Additionally, a tetanus shot was due and was administered.",

did a jump and kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since [doctor] okay so that was about five days ago then [patient] yeah yeah that was last weekend [doctor] last weekend okay now which knee is it [patient] it's my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened [patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards [doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance [patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore [doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before [patient] no that was the first time [doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake [patient] lake martin [doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier [patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can [doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day [patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway [doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked [patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days [doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing [patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it [doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all [patient] no just the swelling and the pain [doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain [patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day [doctor] okay and [patient] putting a cold pack on it [doctor] okay and has that helped at all [patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though [doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here [patient] i had my tonsils out [doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press [patient] yeah that's sore [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt [patient] yeah do n't do that anymore [doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that [patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan [doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions [patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me [doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye [patient] thank you",

he started playing basketball and there we do multiple seasons and so we're kinda getting ready for the next season that starts in in april and we were at the courts plan and i went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers i guess he could say and so he he found me while i was going for a lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen [doctor] yeah [patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym [doctor] okay [patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so [doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way [patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys [doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad [patient] yeah yes [doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too [patient] yeah a little bit [doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all [patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid [doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable [patient] yeah [doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches [patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach [doctor] great [patient] starting in april so [doctor] alright well [patient] how long [doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again [patient] okay [doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly [patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out [doctor] yeah i i'm a dog walker as well so alright sorry for the bad news but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do [patient] alright thank you doctor [doctor] alright thanks",

           "source":"[doctor] hey gregory good to see you today so take a look at my notes and i see that you're here you've had a nonhealing foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks [patient] okay sounds great thanks document [doctor] alright great",
           "summary":"Gregory, a patient with diabetes, visited the doctor for a non-healing foot ulcer that had recently become red and draining. He believes he got the ulcer from walking barefoot on Dewey Beach. He had not yet picked up the antibiotics his PCP prescribed. The doctor performed a physical exam and found a 1 by 2-inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot, with redness, drainage, and edema. There was no evidence of osteomyelitis on X-ray. The doctor plans to order an ABI ankle brachial index, perform a debridement, prescribe clindamycin, and provide a surgical shoe. Gregory will return in two weeks for a follow-up.",

.\n[patient] nice to meet you , ma'am .\nHow are you ?\n[doctor] i'm doing good , thank you .\nSo you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ?\n[patient] yes .\nThat's right .\n[doctor] okay .\nPerfect .\nLet me just get logged in , here .\nHave you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?\n[patient] no , i have n't .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how long have you been considering this ?\n[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years .\nBut i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .\n[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .\n[patient] okay , that's reassuring .\n[doctor] yeah .\nSo what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having .\nAnd then i'll do a quick exam .\n[patient] okay .\nThat sounds good .\n[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails .\nAnd , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?\n[patient] i have blue cross blue shield .\nWell , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .\n[doctor] okay .\nWhat we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company .\nAnd what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not .\nBut we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance .\nDo you know when you'll be on the new plan ?\n[patient] most likely july .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?\n[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years .\nI do have a lotta pain here and here .\nBut i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not .\nIt gets painful and builds up .\nSo i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd in your neck and your upper back .\nAnd how long has this been going on ?\nWould you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?\n[patient] i would say since i was in high school .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ?\nUm , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .\n[patient] yes .\nI do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often .\nI mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable .\nAnd the others are expensive in my size .\n[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well .\nAnd , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?\n[patient] no , i do not have any kids now .\nBut we might plan to in the future .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?\n[patient] sometimes , yes .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ?\nAnd , and it could be from sweating .\n[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?\n[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running .\nAnd it hurts .\n[doctor] and it hurts , okay .\nAnd , and you saw a chiropractor .\nBut what about physical therapy for your back pain ?\nOr do you take any pain medicine for it ?\n[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .\n[doctor] that's okay .\nSo let's see .\nI know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family .\nHave you had any mammograms ?\nAnd how old was your mother when she had it ?\n[patient] mom was 40 .\nAnd they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram .\nI'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 .\nSo i'm still a little bit young .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?\n[patient] yes , for the most part .\nI lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .\n[doctor] congratulations .\nThat's great .\nAnd then , um- [patient] thank you .\n[doctor] .\nSo then ... you're welcome .\nAnd so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ?\nAnd then , um , you said that you were going to school .\nWhat are you going to school for ?\n[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .\n[doctor] okay , that's great .\nAll right .\nSo what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look .\nI'm gon na take a couple of measurements .\nAnd we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards .\nUm , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia .\nOkay .\nSo , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] okay .\nWell , thank you so much .\nIt looks like i have all the measurements that we need .\nYou can go ahead and cover up now .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction .\nWhen we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .\n[patient] okay .\nThat's fine .\n[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .\n[patient] right .",

           "source":"[doctor] hey kyle it's nice to see you today can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in [patient] yeah i went to see my pcp for a cough which they diagnosed as bronchitis but then they did that chest x-ray to make sure i did n't have pneumonia and they found this lung nodule i went for a cat scan that confirmed it and they referred me here to you i'm really nervous document [doctor] okay well first of all i'm i'm sorry that you're nervous and what we're gon na do is we're gon na partner together okay and i'm gon na be right by your side the whole time to hopefully make you a little less nervous and and recognize the fact that we're you're gon na have a big support team around you okay [patient] okay [doctor] so let's talk a little bit about how long you've had that cough before you went to see your doctor [patient] i you know off and on i've had it for about three months i first noticed it when i was loading some pay i have horses and i i bought you know four hundred bills a day and when i spent a day loading it and then it's i just started coughing a lot more i think around that time and after that i i i just got a cold so that's what sent me to my pcp now i i i do exercise i i do a lot of biking and i typically do n't get sick and my cough has gone away [doctor] okay that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking i love to bike myself i've got a track seventy one hundred hybrid have you been on the the new trails they opened it was the old the old rail the old rail road right away they've opened that up it's like sixty miles of trails [patient] i love that that road i just i i do n't like riding on the road so i prefer to do those rails the trails type [doctor] yeah [patient] and it's just so phenomenal i do that a lot [doctor] yeah i love riding over there way we will we will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride [patient] absolutely i'd love it [doctor] that'd be great so i see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time and and and what do you do to to take care of your ra [patient] yeah it's it's it's fair you know arthritis never really goes away but i take methotrexate [doctor] okay [patient] i think it's seven and a half milligrams every week and as long as i'm keeping active my joints feel okay and if i do have any problems it's it's mostly with my hands but i have n't had any recent flares so i'm okay right now [doctor] okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking [patient] i stopped smoking probably about seven years ago [doctor] okay [patient] and i was young and should have stopped the way before that my kids were on me all the time but you know i i got a new start and finally was able to stop and i felt better after stopping [doctor] okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that [patient] no not at all [doctor] okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies [patient] no lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer but she is doing well now [doctor] okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that [patient] no no not not anything that i'm aware of [doctor] okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process [patient] no i do n't think so i think i'll be okay i'm scared [doctor] i i know you're scared but we'll be right here with you the whole way [patient] okay [doctor] alright we'll get some paperwork and i'll see you again in a few minutes [patient] okay thank you",

           "source":"When you think of a laboratory you wouldn't usually think of cheering crowds or actors in costumes.\nYou might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight.\nBut shakespeare's globe on london's bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers.\nEverything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics the globe's site beside the river thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse.\nBuilding this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the sam wanamaker playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself.\nFarah karim-cooper, one of the globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources.\nThe design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of \"informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence\".\nBut this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating \"authenticity\", says dr karim-cooper.\nThe buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences.\n\"we're not interested in re-enactment,\" she says.\nBut she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice.\nLike how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre?\nIt was something that happened regularly in shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor globe to an indoor playhouse such as the blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the river thames.\nIt must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub.\nThe globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight.\nThe globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light.\nAnd in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles.\nLight and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era.\n\"darkness was a terrifying presence,\" says dr karim-cooper.\n\"darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick.\nIt was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.\"\nShe says that if elizabethans or jacobeans travelled in time to modern london \"their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light\".\nAnother big difference is that shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.\nThe modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.\nIn the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen.\nThe really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.\nAnd one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.\n\"it was a very social occasion,\" says dr karim-cooper, describing the shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.\n\"contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,\" she says.\nPutting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.\nFor instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says dr karim-cooper.\nModern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue.\nWhen the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.\nThere are other big changes between a modern and shakespearean theatre visit.\nIt would have smelled very different, says dr karim-cooper.\nThere would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.\nAnother sensory difference would have been the \"soundscape\", she says.\nIt would have been a much softer sound, as elizabethan london didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.\n\"in terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,\" she says.\n\"there are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming.\nThey never heard a plane taking off.\"\nThe language would have sounded unusual too.\nThe accent of the time would have meant words such as \"move\" and \"love\" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.\nAnd the globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.\nThe role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.\n\"there is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do.\nIt wouldn't work,\" says dr karim-cooper.\nInstead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions.\nThey pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.\n\"we want to get beyond wikipedia,\" she says.\nShe is co-editor of moving shakespeare indoors, a collection of essays on indoor jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the globe's work.\nThere is a postgraduate degree course in shakespeare studies with king's college, london.\nThere are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers.\nEvery year there is a landmark schools production, the playing shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for london pupils.\nIt's been a huge success, with many  coming to see shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before.\nDr karim-cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory.\n\"we want to become a research hub.\nWe want students to be here.\"\nThe \"unique blend\" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the \"literary rigour\".\n\"we don't separate the practical from the academic.\"",

           "summary":"A student suffered injuries to his hand and temporary hearing loss after a handmade firecracker exploded in his hand. He had traded some magnesium powder for the firecracker with a fellow student who is interested in guns and explosives. He initially attempted to detonate it in an empty classroom, but the fuse disintegrated before anything happened. Working under the assumption it was a dud, the student used his lighter to reignite it, causing an explosion that resulted in heavy bruising to his fingers, temporary deafness and tinnitus. The student, planning to take a private pilot license course, fears he may now have permanent hearing damage. After the incident, he resolved to think things through more carefully before making decisions in the future.",

           "source":"Police in germany have charged a man suspected of being behind an attack on the borussia dortmund team bus.\nRather than having links to radical islamism, he was a market trader hoping to make money if the price of shares in the team fell, prosecutors say.\nThe suspect has been charged with attempted murder, triggering explosions and causing serious physical injury.\nHe has been  identified only as sergej w, and was staying in the team's hotel overlooking the scene of the attack.\nTwo people needed medical help after three bombs exploded near the bus.\nSpanish footballer marc bartra underwent wrist surgery and a police officer was treated for shock.\nFollowing the attack on 11 april, borussia dortmund's home champions league match against monaco was rescheduled a day later, which led dortmund fans to open their doors to stranded away supporters.\nPolice initially treated the blast as a terrorist attack.\nHowever, the following week, investigators cast \"significant doubt\" on jihadist motivations being behind it.\nThey now say the attack was in fact motivated by financial greed.\nSergej w, 28, would have made about \u20ac3.9m euros ($4.2m; \u00a33.2m) from his actions, germany's bild newspaper reported.\nIn a statement on friday (in german), the german federal prosecutor's office said he has german and russian nationality.\nHe was arrested on friday near tubingen in rottenburg, south-west germany.\nThe suspect had allegedly bought 15,000 put options on borussia dortmund shares - reportedly priced at \u20ac78,000 (\u00a365,000; $83,600) - betting that they would drop sharply after the attack.\nHe would have made large profits if the team's share price collapsed.\nExperts have likened the alleged plot to a sophisticated form of insider trading - because he tried to use information not widely available to the public to make money quickly.\nHe was staying at the team's l'arriv\u00e9e hotel in dortmund on the day of the attack and had moved to a room on the top floor, overlooking the street where it took place, prosecutors say.\nThe suspect placed the bet on 11 april using an ip address traced to the hotel, after taking out a loan for the money.\nInvestigators believe three explosive devices packed with metal pins were hidden in a hedge and set off as the bus passed.\nThe bus was damaged about six miles from the westfalenstadion - officially called signal iduna park - in dortmund about 90 minutes before kick-off.\nPictures from the scene showed its windows broken and its tyres burst.",
           "summary":"A Russian man has been arrested for plotting a terrorist attack in Germany, which targeted Borussia Dortmund players and staff. The 28-year-old, known as Sergej W, had reportedly bought shares in the team and betted on a fall in their value to pocket a hefty profit. Investigators suspect he was motivated by money after finding evidence of debt and financial problems, however, they say his motives were still unclear. His 15,000 put options reportedly brought in \u20ac3.9m in profits, but the suspects say this was simply an elaborate form of insider trading.",

better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all [patient] hmmm hmmm [doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that [patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me [doctor] okay [patient] so i do n't try to go there often [doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam [patient] okay",

           "summary":"Mrs. Anderson, a 44-year-old female, came into the doctor's office with complaints of a week-long left shoulder pain. She explained that the pain started after a possible mishap in her gymnastics class. She had tried managing the pain with Tylenol for some days but did not find success. After examining Mrs. Anderson's shoulder and reviewing her x-ray, the doctor found no broken bone or fracture. Instead, it was speculated that Mrs. Anderson had hurt her joint. He suggested she use a pain reliever, specifically 600 milligram of ibuprofen three times a day for a week. The doctor also recommended the application of an ice or heat pad if the pain persisted.",

           "source":"[doctor] hey kyle it's nice to see you today can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in [patient] yeah i went to see my pcp for a cough which they diagnosed as bronchitis but then they did that chest x-ray to make sure i did n't have pneumonia and they found this lung nodule i went for a cat scan that confirmed it and they referred me here to you i'm really nervous document [doctor] okay well first of all i'm i'm sorry that you're nervous and what we're gon na do is we're gon na partner together okay and i'm gon na be right by your side the whole time to hopefully make you a little less nervous and and recognize the fact that we're you're gon na have a big support team around you okay [patient] okay [doctor] so let's talk a little bit about how long you've had that cough before you went to see your doctor [patient] i you know off and on i've had it for about three months i first noticed it when i was loading some pay i have horses and i i bought you know four hundred bills a day and when i spent a day loading it and then it's i just started coughing a lot more i think around that time and after that i i i just got a cold so that's what sent me to my pcp now i i i do exercise i i do a lot of biking and i typically do n't get sick and my cough has gone away [doctor] okay that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking i love to bike myself i've got a track seventy one hundred hybrid have you been on the the new trails they opened it was the old the old rail the old rail road right away they've opened that up it's like sixty miles of trails [patient] i love that that road i just i i do n't like riding on the road so i prefer to do those rails the trails type [doctor] yeah [patient] and it's just so phenomenal i do that a lot [doctor] yeah i love riding over there way we will we will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride [patient] absolutely i'd love it [doctor] that'd be great so i see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time and and and what do you do to to take care of your ra [patient] yeah it's it's it's fair you know arthritis never really goes away but i take methotrexate [doctor] okay [patient] i think it's seven and a half milligrams every week and as long as i'm keeping active my joints feel okay and if i do have any problems it's it's mostly with my hands but i have n't had any recent flares so i'm okay right now [doctor] okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking [patient] i stopped smoking probably about seven years ago [doctor] okay [patient] and i was young and should have stopped the way before that my kids were on me all the time but you know i i got a new start and finally was able to stop and i felt better after stopping [doctor] okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that [patient] no not at all [doctor] okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies [patient] no lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer but she is doing well now [doctor] okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that [patient] no no not not anything that i'm aware of [doctor] okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that

           "summary":"Kyle, a patient with a previous history of bronchitis and rheumatoid arthritis, visits a doctor due to the detection of a lung nodule during a chest x-ray. The doctor reassures him that he would have a strong support team and inquires about his cough, lifestyle and medical history. Kyle, an ex-smoker who stopped smoking seven years ago, explains he exercises frequently, enjoys biking and takes methotrexate to manage his arthritis. After carrying out a physical exam, the doctor outlines a plan to remove the lung nodule through a video-assisted thoracoscopy, involving general anesthesia and a likely hospital stay. The doctor also advises Kyle to continue his current medication and check-ups for his arthritis.",

           "summary":"A 43-year-old female patient, Mrs. Martinez, visited the doctor for pain in her right arm, specifically in the distal radius area. She reported that she had been playing tennis and missed the ball, hitting the net pole instead. She experienced swelling and pain in her arm afterward. The doctor performed an examination and found tenderness in the distal radius area, as well as pain in the thumb when flexed. Based on the examination and lack of any fractures on the X-ray, the doctor diagnosed Mrs. Martinez with a strain and contusion to the muscle in her arm.",

           "source":"[doctor] hey kyle it's nice to see you today can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in [patient] yeah i went to see my pcp for a cough which they diagnosed as bronchitis but then they did that chest x-ray to make sure i did n't have pneumonia and they found this lung nodule i went for a cat scan that confirmed it and they referred me here to you i'm really nervous document [doctor] okay well first of all i'm i'm sorry that you're nervous and what we're gon na do is we're gon na partner together okay and i'm gon na be right by your side the whole time to hopefully make you a little less nervous and and recognize the fact that we're you're gon na have a big support team around you okay [patient] okay [doctor] so let's talk a little bit about how long you've had that cough before you went to see your doctor [patient] i you know off and on i've had it for about three months i first noticed it when i was loading some pay i have horses and i i bought you know four hundred bills a day and when i spent a day loading it and then it's i just started coughing a lot more i think around that time and after that i i i just got a cold so that's what sent me to my pcp now i i i do exercise i i do a lot of biking and i typically do n't get sick and my cough has gone away [doctor] okay that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking i love to bike myself i've got a track seventy one hundred hybrid have you been on the the new trails they opened it was the old the old rail the old rail road right away they've opened that up it's like sixty miles of trails [patient] i love that that road i just i i do n't like riding on the road so i prefer to do those rails the trails type [doctor] yeah [patient] and it's just so phenomenal i do that a lot [doctor] yeah i love riding over there way we will we will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride [patient] absolutely i'd love it [doctor] that'd be great so i see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time and and and what do you do to to take care of your ra [patient] yeah it's it's it's fair you know arthritis never really goes away but i take methotrexate [doctor] okay [patient] i think it's seven and a half milligrams every week and as long as i'm keeping active my joints feel okay and if i do have any problems it's it's mostly with my hands but i have n't had any recent flares so i'm okay right now [doctor] okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking [patient] i stopped smoking probably about seven years ago [doctor] okay [patient] and i was young and should have stopped the way before that my kids were on me all the time but you know i i got a new start and finally was able to stop and i felt better after stopping [doctor] okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that [patient] no not at all [doctor] okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies [patient] no lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer but she is doing well now [doctor] okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that [patient] no no not not anything that i'm aware of [doctor] okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process [patient] no i do n't think so i think i'll be okay i'm scared [doctor] i i know you're scared but we'll be right here with you the whole way [patient] okay [doctor] alright we'll get some paperwork and i'll see you again in a few minutes [patient] okay thank you",

           "summary":"Elizabeth, a 66-year-old female, visits the doctor for her annual exam. She is in good spirits as she's been able to socialize more after being vaccinated. She is managing her depression well through therapy and a strong support system. Her blood pressure is under control with lisinopril, and she consistently monitors it. During the physical exam, the doctor notes a slight systolic ejection murmur and trace lower extremity edema. The EKG results appear normal. The doctor encourages Elizabeth to continue with her current strategies for managing her depression and hypertension. She also recommends that Elizabeth schedule a mammogram. Elizabeth inquires about taking all her medications together, and the doctor confirms that it's acceptable.",

           "summary":"A 44-year-old female, Mrs. Anderson, presented with left shoulder pain for a week. She sustained the injury during a gymnastics class and had previously undergone surgery on her left arm. An X-ray revealed no fractures. The doctor advised her to continue using pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or ice/heat pads for a week and to rest her left arm. She was instructed to avoid carrying heavy weights or using her left arm for at least three to four weeks. A follow-up appointment was scheduled in three weeks to assess her progress. If the pain persisted, further investigations, such as an additional X-ray, may be considered.",

           "source":"[patient] hi kenneth how are you the medical assistant told me that you had some knee pain yeah i was getting ready for the holiday weekend and i was out on my boat skiing and i i did a jump and kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since [doctor] okay so that was about five days ago then [patient] yeah yeah that was last weekend [doctor] last weekend okay now which knee is it [patient] it's my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened [patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards [doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance [patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore [doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before [patient] no that was the first time [doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake [patient] lake martin [doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier [patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can [doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day [patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway [doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked [patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days [doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing [patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it [doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all [patient] no just the swelling and the pain [doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain [patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day [doctor] okay and [patient] putting a cold pack on it [doctor] okay and has that helped at all [patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though [doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here [patient] i had my tonsils out [doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press [patient] yeah that's sore [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt [patient] yeah do n't do that anymore [doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that [patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan [doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions [patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me [doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye [patient] thank you",

           "summary":"Bryan experienced sudden back pain and right foot tingling after raking leaves. He had a similar episode three years ago that resolved in a day. He tried ice and Advil but found relief only in a hot shower and when sitting. He is normally inactive. His partner reported that the pain worsened when standing. An X-ray of his low back was normal. The doctor diagnosed a low back sprain, prescribed meloxicam and physical therapy, and advised him to follow up if the pain persisted after two weeks. Bryan's partner advocated for an immediate MRI due to concerns about the severity and duration of the pain. The doctor suggested waiting two weeks before considering an MRI.",

better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all [patient] hmmm hmmm [doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that [patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me [doctor] okay [patient] so i do n't try to go there often [doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam [patient] okay",

           "source":"[doctor] hey kyle it's nice to see you today can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in [patient] yeah i went to see my pcp for a cough which they diagnosed as bronchitis but then they did that chest x-ray to make sure i did n't have pneumonia and they found this lung nodule i went for a cat scan that confirmed it and they referred me here to you i'm really nervous document [doctor] okay well first of all i'm i'm sorry that you're nervous and what we're gon na do is we're gon na partner together okay and i'm gon na be right by your side the whole time to hopefully make you a little less nervous and and recognize the fact that we're you're gon na have a big support team around you okay [patient] okay [doctor] so let's talk a little bit about how long you've had that cough before you went to see your doctor [patient] i you know off and on i've had it for about three months i first noticed it when i was loading some pay i have horses and i i bought you know four hundred bills a day and when i spent a day loading it and then it's i just started coughing a lot more i think around that time and after that i i i just got a cold so that's what sent me to my pcp now i i i do exercise i i do a lot of biking and i typically do n't get sick and my cough has gone away [doctor] okay that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking i love to bike myself i've got a track seventy one hundred hybrid have you been on the the new trails they opened it was the old the old rail the old rail road right away they've opened that up it's like sixty miles of trails [patient] i love that that road i just i i do n't like riding on the road so i prefer to do those rails the trails type [doctor] yeah [patient] and it's just so phenomenal i do that a lot [doctor] yeah i love riding over there way we will we will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride [patient] absolutely i'd love it [doctor] that'd be great so i see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time and and and what do you do to to take care of your ra [patient] yeah it's it's it's fair you know arthritis never really goes away but i take methotrexate [doctor] okay [patient] i think it's seven and a half milligrams every week and as long as i'm keeping active my joints feel okay and if i do have any problems it's it's mostly with my hands but i have n't had any recent flares so i'm okay right now [doctor] okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking [patient] i stopped smoking probably about seven years ago [doctor] okay [patient] and i was young and should have stopped the way before that my kids were on me all the time but you know i i got a new start and finally was able to stop and i felt better after stopping [doctor] okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that [patient] no not at all [doctor] okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies [patient] no lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer but she is doing well now [doctor] okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that [patient] no no not not anything that i'm aware of [doctor] okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process [patient] no i do n't think so i think i'll be okay i'm scared [doctor] i i know you're scared but we'll be right here with you the whole way [patient] okay [doctor] alright we'll get some paperwork and i'll see you again in a few minutes [patient] okay thank you",
           "summary":"The document discusses a patient who went to see their primary care physician (PCP) for a cough, which was diagnosed as bronchitis. The patient then had a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia, which revealed a lung nodule. A cat scan confirmed the nodule, and the patient was referred to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment. The patient is nervous about the diagnosis and the upcoming procedure. The specialist explains that the patient will have a support team around them and will be kept informed throughout the process. The specialist also explains that the patient will have a chest CT and a PFT to determine if the nodule is metabolically active and to assess the patient's lung function.",

now [doctor] okay [patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially [patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend [doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me [patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe [doctor] okay [patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah [doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain [patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot [doctor] okay [patient] let me separate these [doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area [patient] no nothing like that [doctor] okay now do you have any weakness [patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no [doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels [patient] no [doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they [patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery [doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like [patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years [doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf [patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back [doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right [patient] exactly [doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions [patient] no i ca n't recall any family members [doctor] okay alright and do you smoke [patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago [doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here [patient] okay [doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit [patient] okay that's painful [doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that [patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time [doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year [patient] okay okay [doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour [patient] okay [doctor] okay [patient] alright sounds good [doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection [patient] alright thank you [doctor] alright thank you [patient] bye",

have you had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks [patient] okay sounds great thanks document [doctor] alright great",

what's going on with your ankle [patient] well we had a long spring and the other day we got some snow and ice i was walking to my car and i slipped and my left ankle kinda turned underneath me [doctor] okay and so this happened couple days ago or how many days ago [patient] two days ago [doctor] two days ago okay and so it's your left ankle and it kinda just twisted underneath you on the kind of on the inside [patient] yeah more on the it's more on the outside of my hips [doctor] and did you fall down or did you just kind of cut catch yourself [patient] no i fell [doctor] okay and were you able to get up afterwards or somebody helped you up [patient] i was but it was very sore and then started swelling and quite a bit of pain so it's hard to walk [doctor] sure have you tried anything for pain or the swelling or anything like that [patient] ibuprofen some ice and elevation [doctor] okay has that helped much or not really [patient] a little bit [doctor] okay and any pain above your ankle does it hurt on your on your calf or your lower leg at all or knee at all [patient] no it's mostly just the outside of my ankle [doctor] okay got it and no bleeding or i'm sure it's a little swollen probably [patient] yeah it's swollen but no bleeding [doctor] well i'll have you take off your shoes in a second we'll examine you in a second but since you're here and i wanted to talk about some of your other things that you know we have n't i have n't seen you in a year so let's talk about your history of diabetes as well are you taking the metformin how's your blood sugars been how how're you managing that any issues with that [patient] no they've been pretty stable [doctor] okay [patient] so with my diet [doctor] good [patient] so [doctor] you're checking your sugars regularly as well [patient] yes [doctor] okay your hemoglobin a1c last time i looked at epic was about six .\nEight which is really good so i think you're doing a great job we had talked about you know cutting off the sweets and sugars and stuff like that and exercising so it sounds like you're you're you're doing a pretty good job with that have you seen the ophthalmologist recently for your eye exam for your diabetes checkup or no [patient] i am due for one of those in the next couple of weeks [doctor] okay alright so we'll so you do you already have an appointment or do you need to make an appointment for that [patient] i have an appointment [doctor] perfect excellent okay and how is your blood pressure been i know we watching it your blood pressure today looks pretty good it's about one seventy over i'm sorry one twenty over seventy you're taking norvasc any issues with that any do you need any refills or anything [patient] i need a refill on that yes [doctor] okay alright well let me examine you here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my match exam and i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put that into my record okay so your neck exam is fine there is no bruits your lungs are clear your heart exam is normal you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is i think you probably have an ankle sprain but i would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone and i'm sometimes worried about a fracture so i'm gon na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you [patient] that's a great plan i need to get back to exercising so [doctor] okay [patient] thank you [doctor] perfect and for the diabetes keep the eye appointment that you already have you know continue with the metformin i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check some baseline labs as well since it's been a while since we checked them and then once if you have any issues or you know give me a call we can get you into the office and for the high blood pressure i'll go ahead and refill the norvasc today you're doing a great job with that it sounds like continue to monitor that if something changes certainly call me we can get you in sooner okay [patient] thank you [doctor] sounds good sounds good good great seeing you thanks stephanie [patient] thank you",

           "summary":"Wayne visited the doctor for a sore on his right foot that had not healed for two to three weeks. His PCP referred him to the doctor, as he had neuropathy and the wound was not improving with antibiotics. The wound was circular, one by two inches, and located on the lateral right foot near the fifth MTP joint. There was yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue, no surrounding erythema or cellulitis, no fluid collection, necrosis, or odor. X-rays of the right foot showed no evidence of osteomyelitis. The doctor plans to perform a debridement, prescribe collagenase ointment, and have Wayne wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. The doctor also recommends an ankle brachial index (ABI)",

i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen [doctor] yeah [patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym [doctor] okay [patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so [doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way [patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys [doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad [patient] yeah yes [doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too [patient] yeah a little bit [doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all [patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid [doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable [patient] yeah [doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches [patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach [doctor] great [patient] starting in april so [doctor] alright well [patient] how long [doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again [patient] okay [doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly [patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out [doctor] yeah i i'm a dog walker as well so alright sorry for the bad news but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do [patient] alright thank you doctor [doctor] alright thanks",

           "summary":"A patient visited a doctor for back pain that started after raking leaves. The patient had a history of back pain that went away on its own. The doctor examined the patient and found limited flexion and extension, pain with palpation, and normal reflexes. The doctor diagnosed a sprained low back and prescribed meloxicam and physical therapy. The patient's partner reported that the patient's pain worsens when standing up. The doctor suggested waiting two weeks and then getting an MRI if the pain persists.",

           "source":"[doctor] hello larry how are you doing today [patient] i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you for this back pain that i've been having for a couple of years now [doctor] okay [patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially [patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend [doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me [patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe [doctor] okay [patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah [doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain [patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot [doctor] okay [patient] let me separate these [doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area [patient] no nothing like that [doctor] okay now do you have any weakness [patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no [doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels [patient] no [doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they [patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery [doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like [patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years [doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf [patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back [doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right [patient] exactly [doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions [patient] no i ca n't recall any family members [doctor] okay alright and do you smoke [patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago [doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here [patient] okay [doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit [patient] okay that's painful [doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that [patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time [doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year [patient] okay okay [doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour [patient] okay [doctor] okay [patient] alright sounds good [doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection [patient] alright thank you [doctor] alright thank you [patient] bye",

have you had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks [patient] okay sounds great thanks document

           "summary":"Albert is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history of depression, type 2 diabetes, and kidney transplant. He presented to the emergency room due to high blood sugar readings over the weekend, but was not admitted to the hospital. His mother had a fall and underwent a hip replacement, which may have contributed to his elevated blood sugar. Albert is currently following a diet and taking immunotherapy meds for his kidney transplant. He reports feeling better since the visit to the emergency room and has been following his diet closely. Albert's depression has been improving, but he still experiences occasional moments of stress.",

           "summary":"The author made an error by cleaning his earrings with peroxide and inadvertently leaving them in the solution for over a week. When he removed them, he did not rinse them or the peroxide off his hands before going to bed. He suddenly felt a burning sensation on his nose and hands and realised his skin was being bleached by the residual peroxide. He contacted poison control and has begun the process of flushing his skin with water. The mistake has resulted in mild bleach burns and prevented him from getting to sleep due to the discomfort.",
