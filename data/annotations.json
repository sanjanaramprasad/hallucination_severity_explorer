or else the actors themselves carry candles.\nLight and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era.\n\"darkness was a terrifying presence,\" says dr karim-cooper.\n\"darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick.\nIt was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.\"\nShe says that if elizabethans or jacobeans travelled in time to modern london \"their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light\".\nAnother big difference is that shakespeare''s audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.\nThe modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.\nIn the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen.\nThe really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.\nAnd one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed globe is that it''s impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.\n\"it was a very social occasion,\" says dr karim-cooper, describing the shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.\n\"contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,\" she says.\nPutting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.\nFor instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says dr karim-cooper.\nModern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue.\nWhen the audience and actors are looking into each other''s eyes, it becomes a different moment.\nThere are other big changes between a modern and shakespearean theatre visit.\nIt would have smelled very different, says dr karim-cooper.\nThere would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.\nAnother sensory difference would have been the \"soundscape\", she says.\nIt would have been a much softer sound, as elizabethan london didn''t have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.\n\"in terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,\" she says.\n\"there are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming.\nThey never heard a plane taking off.\"\nThe language would have sounded unusual too.\nThe accent of the time would have meant words such as \"move\" and \"love\" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.\nAnd the globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.\nThe role of the theatre''s research team isn''t to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.\n\"there is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do.\nIt wouldn''t work,\" says dr karim-cooper.\nInstead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions.\nThey pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.\n\"we want to get beyond wikipedia,\" she says.\nShe is co-editor of moving shakespeare indoors, a collection of essays on indoor jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the globe''s work.\nThere is a postgraduate degree course in shakespeare studies with king''s college, london.\nThere are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers.\nEvery year there is a landmark schools production, the playing shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for london pupils.\nIt''s been a huge success, with many  coming to see shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before.\nDr karim-cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory.\n\"we want to become a research hub.\nWe want students to be here.\"\nThe \"unique blend\" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the \"literary rigour\".\n\"we don''t separate the practical from the academic.\"", "summary": "Shakespeare''s Globe in London uses its in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisors to ensure everything from physical design to performances is historically accurate, yet engaging for modern audiences.

n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on

can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that [patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan [doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions [patient] i

with your swallowing problem [patient] well it's just been something that i have noticed over the last you know four to five weeks it seems like something is always stuck in my throat and you know just i kinda go about my day and it kinda bothers me you know a little bit sometimes a little painful and when i try to eat it just seems like i have to i do n't know when it's something solid i kinda have to wash it down on occasion i i've never really fully choked but i have to admit that i've thought about potentially choking [doctor] okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing [patient] no coughing just kinda when i swallow it's all okay with liquids but when i kinda swallow you know like a bite of a sandwich sometimes it just feels like like i just need a little help pushing it down [doctor] okay and is it more kind of a like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that [patient] i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think it's probably more with solids [doctor] okay how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids is there is there a temperature change any modification to that [patient] it's really just about solids [doctor] okay alright so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all [patient] no [doctor] okay that so no vomiting blood no coughing up blood or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all [patient] not that i want [doctor] okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this [patient] no [doctor] okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven .\nFour we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going [patient] i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise [doctor] okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all [patient] yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time [doctor] and how are the numbers looking [patient] they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting [doctor] okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that [patient] no [doctor] okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home [patient] i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range [doctor] okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or get you referred to the er if needed any questions about that [patient] no that sounds great [doctor] okay and for the diabetes i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c i'm gon na order some more blood

see you back in about a month and i think that's it for that any questions about that [patient] no [doctor] okay and the high blood pressure i think you're doing great continue with the norvasc if you have any issues certainly call me but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that did we forget anything or do you need refills for anything [patient] you know i think i'm low on the norvasc so if you could send something to my pharmacy that would be great [doctor] okay sure i'll get you a refill for norvasc we'll get that sent over to the pharmacy okay [patient] thank you

symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you

to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful

basis [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all [patient] hmmm hmmm [doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that [patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me [doctor] okay [patient] so i do n't try to go there often [doctor] okay thank you for sharing

.\nThat's right .\n[doctor] okay .\nPerfect .\nLet me just get logged in , here .\nHave you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?\n[patient] no , i have n't .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how long have you been considering this ?\n[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years .\nBut i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .\n[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .\n[patient] okay , that's reassuring .\n[doctor] yeah .\nSo what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having .\nAnd then i'll do a quick exam .\n[patient] okay .\nThat sounds good .\n[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails .\nAnd ,

believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .\n[doctor] okay .\nWhat we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company .\nAnd what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not .\nBut we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance .\nDo you know when you'll be on the new plan ?\n[patient] most likely july .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?\n[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years .\nI do have a lotta pain here and here .\nBut i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not .\nIt gets painful and builds up .\nSo i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd in your neck and your upper back .\nAnd how long has this been going on ?\nWould you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?\n[patient] i would say since i was in high school .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ?\nUm , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .\n[patient] yes .\nI do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often .\nI mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable .\nAnd the others are expensive in my size .\n[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well .\nAnd , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?\n[patient] no , i do not have any kids now .\nBut we might plan to in the future .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?\n[patient] sometimes , yes .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ?\nAnd , and it could be from sweating .\n[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?\n[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running .\nAnd it hurts .\n[doctor] and it hurts , okay .\nAnd , and you saw a chiropractor .\nBut what about physical therapy for your back pain ?\nOr do you take any pain medicine for it ?\n[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .\n[doctor] that's okay .\nSo let's see .\nI know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family .\nHave you had any mammograms ?\nAnd how old was your mother when she had it ?\n[patient] mom was 40 .\nAnd they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram .\nI'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 .\nSo i'm still a little bit young .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?\n[patient] yes , for the most part .\nI lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .\n[doctor] congratulations .\nThat's great .\nAnd then , um- [patient] thank you .\n[doctor] .\nSo then ... you're welcome .\nAnd so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ?\nAnd then , um , you said that you were going to school .\nWhat are you going to school for ?\n[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .\n[doctor] okay , that's great .\nAll right .\nSo what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look .\nI'm gon na take a couple of measurements .\nAnd we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards .\nUm , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia .\nOkay .\nSo , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] okay .\nWell , thank you so much .\nIt looks like i have all the measurements that we need .\nYou can go ahead and cover up now .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction .\nWhen we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .\n[patient] okay .\nThat's fine .\n[doctor] and

us so we could help .\n[patient] so what are the possible treatments ?\n[doctor] well , we have a few options you can try .\nFirst option would be to start with physical therapy .\nI would recommend two sessions per week as well as any other exercises they give you to do at home .\nWe can start there and if that does n't improve your pain , then we could try a cortisone injection .\n[patient] i like the idea of starting with the physical therapy and have a next step if it does n't help .\nI am not opposed to a shot but would like to try the therapy first .\n[doctor] all right .\nGreat .\nI'll get a referral order , and they will call you within the next day or two to get you scheduled .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\nAlso , please continue to ice , especially your shoulder , and rest as much as you can .\n[patient] okay .\nI will .\n[doctor] give us a call or email us if you have symptoms worsen , if your symptoms worsen or do not improve with the therapy .\n[patient]

seems like i''m always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i''m sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it''s really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt''s house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it''s because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n''t really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they''ll give me antibiotics sometimes i''ll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it''s a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n''t work [doctor] okay so do you think that''s the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that''s the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i''m using my inhaler because i''m always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i''ll wake up as a couple times a week i''ll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you''ve had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [patient] yeah i feel like i''ve had several i do n''t remember the exact number but i''ve had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they''ll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt''s house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n''t have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n''t have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center [patient] yeah i''m really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i''m really i''m looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis [patient] no i''ve never smoked and i do n''t vape either or yeah i do n''t smoke cigarettes or marijuana [doctor] okay and then you said you do n''t vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all [patient] hmmm hmmm [doctor] okay and then are you

ulcer so can you tell me how you''re doing how long have you had it what''s going on with it [patient] sure so i''ve had it for about two months now and it''s recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it''s healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n''t i did n''t pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n''t recall the name exactly [doctor] do n''t recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i''m sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n''t i do n''t have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n''t had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that''s probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n''t check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i''m not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i''m pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that''s that''s definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n''t gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n''t have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it''s just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that''s coming out of it i do n''t see any necrosis you do n''t have any odor and i do n''t appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it''s it''s red it''s swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it''s not distinct [doctor] okay alright that''s good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n''t have a bone infection so that''s great i think it''s just in your skin so let''s talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i''m gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i''m gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that''s happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n''t they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i''ll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we''ll possibly do another debridement at that time we''ll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it''s an emergency if you feel like you''re getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything

like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse [doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there [patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time [doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version [patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden [doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at [patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month [doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes [patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here [doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me [patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg [doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life [patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten [doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better [patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down [doctor] okay [patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today [doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs [patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well [doctor] that's okay [patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day [doctor] absolutely [patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them [doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here [patient] no it's right here [doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there [patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks [doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please [patient] okay that's it that's all i got [doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan [patient] sure sounds good [doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na

or else the actors themselves carry candles.\nLight and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era.\n\"darkness was a terrifying presence,\" says dr karim-cooper.\n\"darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick.\nIt was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.\"\nShe says that if elizabethans or jacobeans travelled in time to modern london \"their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light\".\nAnother big difference is that shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.\nThe modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.\nIn the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen.\nThe really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.\nAnd one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.\n\"it was a very social occasion,\" says dr karim-cooper, describing the shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.\n\"contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,\" she says.\nPutting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.\nFor instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says dr karim-cooper.\nModern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue.\nWhen the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.\nThere are other big changes between a modern and shakespearean theatre visit.\nIt would have smelled very different, says dr karim-cooper.\nThere would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.\nAnother sensory difference would have been the \"soundscape\", she says.\nIt would have been a much softer sound, as elizabethan london didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.\n\"in terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,\" she says.\n\"there are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming.\nThey never heard a plane taking off.\"\nThe language would have sounded unusual too.\nThe accent of the time would have meant words such as \"move\" and \"love\" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.\nAnd the globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.\nThe role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.\n\"there is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do.\nIt wouldn't work,\" says dr karim-cooper.\nInstead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions.\nThey pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.\n\"we want to get beyond wikipedia,\" she says.\nShe is co-editor of moving shakespeare indoors, a collection of essays on indoor jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the globe's work.\nThere is a postgraduate degree course in shakespeare studies with king's college, london.\nThere are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers.\nEvery year there is a landmark schools production, the playing shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for london pupils.\nIt's been a huge success, with many  coming to see shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before.\nDr karim-cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory.\n\"we want to become a research hub.\nWe want students to be here.\"\nThe \"unique blend\" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the \"literary rigour\".\n\"we don't separate the practical from the academic.\"", "summary": "The Globe Theatre in London is a living laboratory where scholars, researchers, and academic advisors work together to create an authentic experience of Shakespearean theater.

of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .\n[patient] okay , that's reassuring .\n[doctor] yeah .\nSo what i wan na do first is just get a little bit

okay .\n[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?\n[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years .\nI do have a lotta pain here and here .\nBut i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not .\nIt gets painful and builds up .\nSo i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd in your neck

planning to have any children in the future ?\n[patient] no , i do not have any kids now .\nBut we might plan to in the future .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?\n[patient] sometimes , yes .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ?\nAnd , and it could be from sweating .\n[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?\n[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running .\nAnd it hurts .\n[doctor] and it hurts , okay .\nAnd , and you saw a chiropractor .\nBut what about physical therapy for your back pain ?\nOr do you take any pain medicine for it ?\n[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .\n[doctor] that's okay .\nSo let's see .\nI know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family .\nHave you had any mammograms ?\nAnd how old was your mother when she had it ?\n[patient] mom was 40 .\nAnd they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram .\nI'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 .\nSo i'm still a little bit young .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?\n[patient] yes , for the most part .\nI lost about 10 pounds over the past few

you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ?\nAnd then , um , you said that you were going to school .\nWhat are you going to school for ?\n[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .\n[doctor] okay , that's great .\nAll right .\nSo what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look .\nI'm gon na take a couple of measurements .\nAnd we'll

you're a great candidate for a breast reduction .\nWhen we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .\n[patient] okay .\nThat's fine .\n[doctor] and

wanted me to see you for this back pain that i've been having for a couple of years now [doctor] okay [patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially [patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend [doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me [patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe [doctor] okay [patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah [doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain [patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot [doctor] okay [patient] let me separate these [doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area [patient] no nothing like that [doctor] okay now do you have any weakness [patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no [doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels [patient] no [doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they [patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery [doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like [patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years [doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf [patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back [doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right [patient] exactly [doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions [patient] no i ca n't recall any family members [doctor] okay alright and do you smoke [patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago [doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here [patient] okay [doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit [patient] okay that's painful [doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that [patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time [doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year [patient] okay okay [doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour [patient] okay [doctor] okay [patient] alright sounds good [doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection [patient] alright thank you [doctor] alright thank you [patient] bye", "summary": "The patient, Larry, is experiencing chronic back pain that has

and the even smaller decline in the proportion of top a* and a grades - is that there is \"stability\".\nThis isn't an accident.\nThe annual exam results are not like going outside and measuring the temperature as a natural phenomenon which might fluctuate.\nIt's more like setting the central heating to an agreed level and then holding up a thermometer to see if the temperature is where it should be.\nWell, perhaps that's not a complete analogy, but the national exam statistics, with their neat similarity to last year, are a work of design rather than nature.\nThe huge annual challenge for the exam system is to balance a number of competing demands.\nThere has to be room for some slight ups and downs, but there mustn't be grade inflation, standards have to be maintained over time and - at the very heart of the process - it has to be a fair reward for the hard work of individual pupils.\nAdd to this complex equation the need to adjust grades between different exam boards.\nHead teachers' leader brian lightman has complained that below the smooth surface of the national statistics, there can be doubts about the reliability of individual results.\nHe has warned of \"volatility\", with heads unable to explain sudden dips and spikes, problems that remain unnoticed from a national perspective.\n\"it is devastating for a student who has been on course for a certain grade to miss what they were expected to achieve and it is mystifying to their teachers,\" said mr lightman.\nThe lingering question is if one year's results are reverse engineered to be very similar to the year before, does this mean distorting some of the results to make sure that they fit?\nAre there winners and losers in some subjects and at some grades?\nOfqual has always argued that fairness for individual students is not compromised by the demands of the wider results system.\nBut it's a massively complicated challenge for exam boards and regulator - made even more difficult by the conflicting legacies of previous grading systems.\nOnce there was a system of fixed quotas which prevented any rise in grades and then a system which allowed grades to rise every single year.\nNow there is a system which holds out the possibility of change, but which manages to keep things the same.\nAnother factor that gets overlooked in the headlines, is that the results can be changed by who is taking the exam.\nThis year's nudge upwards in the pass rate has come alongside an older cohort.\nThere are fewer 14 and 15 year olds taking the gcses early, because the league tables now only recognise the first attempt.\nAnd another change in government policy means that pupils who missed out on gcse maths and english last year are having to re-sit the exam this year.\nThis means that more than 300,000 exam entries were from 17 year olds.\nBut if the changes at the overall level are measured in fractions of a percentage point, there are some very striking differences between england, northern ireland and wales.\nNorthern ireland's pupils are stretching their lead over everyone else, jumping by 0.7% to 78.7%.\nIt raises the question how such results can be achieved when only 66% make the grade in wales.\nNot only is the northern ireland figure far ahead of england, it is ahead of the highest-achieving part of england, which was london with 72%.\nEngland's education system has been in a state of almost constant reform since the late 1980s, but the latest results show it is northern ireland that is stretching further ahead.\nWhen these regional differences are overlaid with the gender gap, it means that young women in northern ireland are doing much better than anyone else.\nThe scores from the gcse top grades show the gap.\nAmong entries from female pupils in northern ireland, 11.4% achieve a* grades.\nAmong male pupils in wales, the figure is 4.5%.\nIn england, 5.2% of entries from male pupils and 7.9% of female achieve these highest a* grades.\nThis sets a pattern for a-levels and university entry, with northern irish women the most likely in the uk to get university places.\nWhether or not it is going to be consolation for england's school leaders, such comparisons are soon going to be impossible.\nBecause in a couple of years england's gcses will begin to be graded from 9 to 1 rather than a to g, ending a common system with wales and northern ireland.\nAnother curious aside is that many of the pupils taking gcses this year in england did not take their sats tests five years ago, because of a primary school teachers' boycott.\nWhat difference did it make in the long term?\nIt would take another exam to answer that one.", "summary": "The overall national picture for GCSE grades in the UK for 2016 is very similar to the previous year, as the proportion of students who obtained grades between A* and C rose to 69% from 68.8%.

over the last you know four to five weeks it seems like something is always stuck in my throat and you know just i kinda go about my day and it kinda bothers me you know a little bit sometimes a little painful and when i try to eat it just seems like i have to i do n't know when it's something solid i kinda have to wash it down on occasion i i've never really fully choked but i have to admit that i've thought about potentially choking [doctor] okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing [patient] no coughing just kinda when i swallow it's all okay with liquids but when i kinda swallow you know like a bite of a sandwich sometimes it just feels like like i just need a little help pushing it down [doctor] okay and is it more kind of a like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that [patient] i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think it's probably more with solids [doctor] okay how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids is there is there a temperature change any modification to that [patient] it's really just about solids [doctor] okay alright so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all [patient] no [doctor] okay that so no vomiting blood no coughing up blood or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all [patient] not that i want [doctor] okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this [patient] no [doctor] okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven .\nFour we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going [patient] i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise [doctor] okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all [patient] yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time [doctor] and how are the numbers looking [patient] they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting [doctor] okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that [patient] no [doctor] okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home [patient] i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range [doctor] okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that

but roy hodgson's side could not protect their lead.\nEngland's defence lived on the edge too often and were eventually punished when a sloppy passage of play led to danny rose handling, and vincent janssen scored from the spot after 50 minutes.\nThe big striker was then too strong for substitute phil jagielka, although england complained bitterly he had been fouled, before crossing for luciano narsingh to score the winner 13 minutes from  time.\nVardy's transition from the heights he has scaled with leicester city this season to england has been seamless - and he has stepped up a level in the two friendlies against germany and the netherlands.\nThe 29-year-old has been portrayed as both an ideal starter and the perfect impact substitute as hodgson makes plans for euro 2016.\nVardy has proved his capabilities for both, with an explosive 20-minute cameo in berlin that included a brilliantly instinctive finish as part of england's comeback.\nAnd here, he was england's outstanding performer by some distance, showing the pace and energy that has panicked premier league defences and also skill to round off that passing move with a clinical finish before testing dutch keeper jeroen zoet with a powerful rising drive.\nThe debate about how best to use vardy may go on but one thing is beyond dispute - he is going to euro 2016 and has the ability to threaten every defence in france.\nIn an ideal world, everton's john stones would have come in at wembley to produce the sort of elegant display that became his trademark in the early seasons of his career, thus cementing his place alongside chris smalling for england's first euro 2016 game against russia in marseille.\nInstead, wembley witnessed a 21-year-old whose confidence has been hit by a recent dip in form at club level and will need a little renovating before the serious action gets under way.\nStones twice brought murmurs of concern from england's fans inside wembley with his tendency to perhaps over-play out of defence, but his determination to be constructive also started the passing move that led to vardy's goal.\nThe young defender is a work in progress and there will be slips - quite literally when he stumbled at the start of a chain of events that led to england keeper fraser forster having to save well from janssen before rose handled to leave the striker to score from the spot.\nStones is well worth persevering with - but hodgson must hope some of that confidence and composure returns quickly.\nHodgson warned they must not get carried away after victory in germany - and, in case anyone ignored the warning, along comes a defeat against a dutch team that will not even be in france this summer.\nIn some respects this defeat, albeit with a much-changed side, simply reinforced some of the lessons that came out of the win in germany that was the catalyst for such a surge of optimism.\nEngland have some very exciting options up front in the shape of vardy and harry kane, while daniel sturridge also got a decent 57 minutes under his belt.\nQuestions remain, however, about a frail-looking defence with both full-back spots still up for grabs and no central-defensive pairing jumping out as hodgson's first choice at this stage.\nEngland certainly carry a threat but fears persist about their ability to resist attacks of the highest calibre.\nFraser forster: solid night for the southampton keeper despite a couple of fumbles.\nSaved well from georginio wijnaldum and vincent janssen.\nClear deputy to joe hart.\n7.\nKyle walker: solid and quick in defence and a threat in attack with a perfect pass for vardy to score england's goal.\n7.\nChris smalling: part of an uncertain central-defensive partnership that once again hinted at england's frailty against attacks possessing real quality.\n6.\nJohn stones: not a great night for everton's 21-year-old.\nYes, his determination to play started the move for england's goal but too often caused anxiety with his tendency to overdo things and second-half slip started chain of events that led to the dutch equaliser.\n5.\nDanny rose: not an easy night for england's defence but rose kept going and may consider himself unlucky to be punished for the handball that led to a penalty.\n6.\nJames milner: anonymous as england's captain.\nMilner is a solid presence but not big on inspirational moments.\n5.\nDanny drinkwater: solid debut from the leicester city midfielder.\nDid himself no harm and can be happy with his debut but did he make a compelling case for inclusion in euro 2016?\nNot sure.\n6.\nRoss barkley: busy first half and a trademark second-half surge that set up a chance for adam lallana.\n6.\nAdam lallana: decent night for the liverpool midfielder.\nClever pass played its part in england's goal and was warmly applauded when substituted.\n7.\nDaniel sturridge: once he'd stopped fiddling with his bootlaces he settled down and produced one or two moments that hint at the threat he could yet pose for england.\n6.\nJamie vardy: england's star man.\nBusy, scored one and could have had another.\n8.\nSubstitutes: walcott (for sturridge, 57 minutes): odd flash of pace and one rising shot over the bar but otherwise quiet.\n6.\nClyne (for rose, 57 minutes): not much of an opportunity and consequently not much impact.\n5.\nKane (for lallana, 70 minutes): just a couple of half-chances but no rescue act from the man who is now england's first-choice striker.\n5.\nJagielka (for smalling, 70 minutes): claimed he was fouled by janssen in the lead-up to the winner but should have been stronger in that situation.\n5.\nAlli (for milner, 82 minutes): no rating.\nDier (for drinkwater, 84 minutes): no rating.\nThe three lions wait until 21 may to host turkey, while netherlands meet republic of ireland six days later.\nMatch ends, england 1, netherlands 2.\nSecond half ends, england 1, netherlands 2.\nFoul by dele alli (england).\nIbrahim afellay (netherlands) wins a free kick in the defensive half.\nSubstitution, netherlands.\nJordy clasie replaces vincent janssen.\nCorner,  netherlands.\nConceded by phil jagielka.\nSubstitution, england.\nEric dier replaces daniel drinkwater.\nAttempt missed.\nHarry kane (england) left footed shot from outside the box is close, but misses to the right.\nAssisted by phil jagielka.\nSubstitution, netherlands.\nPatrick van aanholt replaces jetro willems.\nSubstitution, england.\nDele alli replaces james milner.\nSubstitution, netherlands.\nMarco van ginkel replaces riechedly bazoer.\nGoal!\nEngland 1, netherlands 2.\nLuciano narsingh (netherlands) right footed shot from the centre of the box to the top right corner.\nAssisted by vincent janssen.\nFoul by kyle walker (england).\nMemphis depay (netherlands) wins a free kick in the attacking half.\nDangerous play by jamie vardy (england).\nLuciano narsingh (netherlands) wins a free kick in the defensive half.\nAttempt blocked.\nHarry kane (england) right footed shot from the centre of the box is blocked.\nAssisted by john stones.\nAttempt missed.\nJohn stones (england) header from the centre of the box misses to the left.\nAssisted by james milner with a cross following a corner.\nCorner,  england.\nConceded by riechedly bazoer.\nRoss barkley (england) wins a free kick in the attacking half.\nDangerous play by ibrahim afellay (netherlands).", "summary": "England was defeated by the Netherlands 2-1 in a friendly match at Wembley Stadium.

if left alone and does n't go away .\nBut , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time .\nUm , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough .\nIf he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe .\nSo , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine .\n[doctor] you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] actually , i will .\nI'll go ahead and just give you some as well .\n[patient_guest] okay .\nOkay .\n[doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it .\nIt only works for the barky cough .\n[patient_guest] mm-hmm , got it .\n[doctor] okay .\nWe'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week .\nSo , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough .\nHe can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age .\nSo , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough .", "summary": "Randy Gutierrez, an 8-month-old baby, has been experiencing symptoms of a cold since the previous evening.

see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your pcp sent you over to see me how're you doing today [patient] pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse [doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there [patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time [doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version [patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden [doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at [patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month [doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes [patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here [doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me [patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg [doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life [patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten [doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better [patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down [doctor] okay [patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today [doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs [patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well [doctor] that's okay [patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day [doctor] absolutely [patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them [doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here [patient] no it's right here [doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there [patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks [doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please [patient] okay that's it that's all i got [doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan [patient] sure sounds good [doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na

six .\nEight which is really good so i think you're doing a great job we had talked about you know cutting off the sweets and sugars and stuff like that and exercising so it sounds like you're you're you're doing a pretty good job with that have you seen the ophthalmologist recently for your eye exam for your diabetes checkup or no [patient] i am due for one of those in the next couple of weeks

you need any refills or anything [patient] i need a refill on that yes [doctor] okay alright well let me examine you here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my match exam and i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put that into my record okay so your neck exam is fine there is no bruits your lungs are clear your heart exam is normal you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is i think you probably have an ankle sprain but i would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone and i'm sometimes worried about a fracture so i'm gon na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you [patient] that's a great plan i need to get back to exercising so [doctor] okay [patient] thank you [doctor] perfect and for the diabetes keep the eye appointment that you already have you know continue with the metformin i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check

become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you

were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened [patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards [doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance [patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore [doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before [patient] no that was the first time [doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake [patient] lake martin [doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier [patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can [doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day [patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor

so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked [patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days [doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing [patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it [doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all [patient] no just the swelling and the pain [doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain [patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day [doctor] okay and

ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press [patient] yeah that's sore [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt [patient] yeah do n't do that anymore [doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that [patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan [doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid

they diagnosed as bronchitis but then they did that chest x-ray to make sure i did n't have pneumonia and they found this lung nodule i went for a cat scan that confirmed it and they referred me here to you i'm really nervous document [doctor] okay well first of all i'm i'm sorry that you're nervous and what we're gon na do is we're gon na partner together okay and i'm gon na be right by your side the whole time to hopefully make you a little less nervous and and recognize the fact that we're you're gon na have a big support team around you okay [patient] okay [doctor] so let's talk a little bit about how long you've had that cough before you went to see your doctor [patient] i you know off and on i've had it for about three months i first noticed it when i was loading some pay i have horses and i i bought you know four hundred bills a day and when i spent a day loading it and then it's i just started coughing a lot more i think around that time and after that i i i just got a cold so that's what sent me to my pcp now i i i do exercise i i do a lot of biking and i typically do n't get sick and my cough has gone away [doctor] okay that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking i love to bike myself i've got a track seventy one hundred hybrid have you been on the the new trails they opened it was the old the old rail the old rail road right away they've opened that up it's like sixty miles of trails [patient] i love that that road i just i i do n't like riding on the road so i prefer to do those rails the trails type [doctor] yeah [patient] and it's just so phenomenal i do that a lot [doctor] yeah i love riding over there way we will we will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride [patient] absolutely i'd love it [doctor] that'd be great so i see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time and and and what do you do to to take care of your ra [patient] yeah it's it's it's fair you know arthritis never really goes away but i take methotrexate [doctor] okay [patient] i think it's seven and a half milligrams every week and as long as i'm keeping active my joints feel okay and if i do have any problems it's it's mostly with my hands but i have n't had any recent flares so i'm okay right now [doctor] okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking [patient] i stopped smoking probably about seven years ago [doctor] okay [patient] and i was young and should have stopped the way before that my kids were on me all the time but you know i i got a new start and finally was able to stop and i felt better after stopping [doctor] okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that [patient] no not at all [doctor] okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies [patient] no lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer but she is doing well now [doctor] okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that [patient] no no not not anything that i'm aware of [doctor] okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process [patient] no i do n't think so i think i'll be okay i'm scared [doctor] i i know you're scared but we'll be right here with you the whole way [patient] okay [doctor] alright we'll get some paperwork and i'll see you again in a few minutes

how long have you had that for ?\nDo you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ?\n[patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur .\nSo of course , i'm worried as well .\n[doctor] got it .\nOkay .\nAnd are you having any symptoms at all ?\n[patient] i do n't think so .\nI do n't know what symptoms i should be having .\n[doctor] okay .\nWell , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one .\nSo i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?\n[patient] no , i definitely do n't .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?\n[patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain .\nUm , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs .\n[doctor] okay , got it , for the legs .\nAnd do you feel short of breath at all ?\n[patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?\n[patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know .\nMaybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .\n[doctor] got it .\nAll right .\n[patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all .\nUm , maybe more if i try to overdo it .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though .\n[doctor] okay , got it .\nAnd so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?\n[patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago .\nBefore that i did n't notice anything at all .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?\n[patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?\n[patient] yeah .\nSo i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd so how about any passing out at all ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay , good .\nAnd how about irregular heartbeats ?\nDo you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?\n[patient] i do n't notice it at all .\n[doctor] okay , great .\nAnd how about any swelling in the legs at all ?\n[patient] yeah , my ankles swell .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how long has this been going on ?\n[patient] um , i would say for probably six months .\nBut it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?\n[patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\nOkay .\n[patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] good .\nSo mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur .\nIs that right ?\nAnd sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?\n[patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd so fatigue as well .\nAnd have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?\n[patient] i'm not really sure .\n[doctor] okay .\nIt does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?\n[patient] yeah , you name it .\n[doctor] all right .\nWell , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record .\nUm , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ?\nAll right .\nGot them .\nAnd then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay , good .\nAnd looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack .\nIs that correct ?\n[patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .\n[doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment .\n[patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke .\nBut that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .\n[doctor] okay , i see .\n[patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .\n[doctor] okay .\nAll right .\nWell , it looks like also that you never smoked .\nThat's excellent .\nAnd then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?\n[patient] correct .\n[doctor] all right .\nWell , let's do a quick exam .\n[patient] all right .\nSounds good .\n[doctor] all right .\nWell , for physical exam , please use the regular template .\nAll right , please just breathe normally .\nGreat .\nAnd now take a few deep breaths for me .\nAll right .\nDo you feel okay ?\nAre you feeling any dizziness or anything ?\n[patient] no , i feel fine .\n[doctor] okay , great .\nAll right .\nWell , that is it for the exam .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right .\nSo what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram .\nIt's a very common test and it just takes a

presents today complaining of difficulty swallowing and has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure so tyler tell me what's going on with your swallowing problem [patient] well it's just been something that i have noticed over the last you know four to five weeks it seems like something is always stuck in my throat and you know just i kinda go about my day and it kinda bothers me you know a little bit sometimes a little painful and when i try to eat it just seems like i have to i do n't know when it's something solid i kinda have to wash it down on occasion i i've never really fully choked but i have to admit that i've thought about potentially choking [doctor] okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing [patient] no coughing just kinda when i swallow it's all okay with liquids but when i kinda swallow you know like a bite of a sandwich sometimes it just feels like like i just need a little help pushing it down [doctor] okay and is it more kind of a like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that [patient] i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think it's probably more with solids [doctor] okay how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids is there is there a temperature change any modification to that [patient] it's really just about solids [doctor] okay alright so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all [patient] no [doctor] okay that so no vomiting blood no coughing up blood or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all [patient] not that i want [doctor] okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this [patient] no [doctor] okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven .\nFour we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going [patient] i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise [doctor] okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all [patient] yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time [doctor] and how are the numbers looking [patient] they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting [doctor] okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that [patient] no [doctor] okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home [patient] i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range [doctor] okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or get you referred to the er if needed any questions about that [patient] no that sounds great [doctor] okay and for the diabetes i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c i'm gon na order some more blood work today we'll check a kidney function and i notice that you have not had an eye referral so i'm gon na also give you an eye referral to ophthalmology to check your eyes for your diabetic for your for any retinopathy continue the metformin i'll have you come back in about a month and that way we'll have the results back for the blood test if we need to make any adjustments we can but i i wan na see you back in about a month and i think that's it for that any questions about that [patient] no [doctor] okay and the high blood pressure i think you're doing great continue with the norvasc if you have any issues certainly call me but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that did we forget anything or do you need refills for anything [patient] you know i think i'm low on the norvasc so if you could send something to my pharmacy that would be great [doctor] okay

this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now .\nOften sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away .\nBut , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time .\nUm , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough .\nIf he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe .\nSo , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine

they were beaten in a friendly by the netherlands, who have not even qualified for euro 2016.\nOn a night when wembley paid its respects to the late dutch legend johan cruyff with applause in the 14th minute, a much-changed england side slipped to a rare defeat at the national stadium.\nMan-of-the-match jamie vardy rounded off a slick passing move to steer in kyle walker's cross four minutes before the interval - but roy hodgson's side could not protect their lead.\nEngland's defence lived on the edge too often and were eventually punished when a sloppy passage of play led to danny rose handling, and vincent janssen scored from the spot after 50 minutes.\nThe big striker was then too strong for substitute phil jagielka, although england complained bitterly he had been fouled, before crossing for luciano narsingh to score the winner 13 minutes from  time.\nVardy's transition from the heights he has scaled with leicester city this season to england has been seamless - and he has stepped up a level in the two friendlies against germany and the netherlands.\nThe 29-year-old has been portrayed as both an ideal starter and the perfect impact substitute as hodgson makes plans for euro 2016.\nVardy has proved his capabilities for both, with an explosive 20-minute cameo in berlin that included a brilliantly instinctive finish as part of england's comeback.\nAnd here, he was england's outstanding performer by some distance, showing the pace and energy that has panicked premier league defences and also skill to round off that passing move with a clinical finish before testing dutch keeper jeroen zoet with a powerful rising drive.\nThe debate about how best to use vardy may go on but one thing is beyond dispute - he is going to euro 2016 and has the ability to threaten every defence in france.\nIn an ideal world, everton's john stones would have come in at wembley to produce the sort of elegant display that became his trademark in the early seasons of his career, thus cementing his place alongside chris smalling for england's first euro 2016 game against russia in marseille.\nInstead, wembley witnessed a 21-year-old whose confidence has been hit by a recent dip in form at club level and will need a little renovating before the serious action gets under way.\nStones twice brought murmurs of concern from england's fans inside wembley with his tendency to perhaps over-play out of defence, but his determination to be constructive also started the passing move that led to vardy's goal.\nThe young defender is a work in progress and there will be slips - quite literally when he stumbled at the start of a chain of events that led to england keeper fraser forster having to save well from janssen before rose handled to leave the striker to score from the spot.\nStones is well worth persevering with - but hodgson must hope some of that confidence and composure returns quickly.\nHodgson warned they must not get carried away after victory in germany - and, in case anyone ignored the warning, along comes a defeat against a dutch team that will not even be in france this summer.\nIn some respects this defeat, albeit with a much-changed side, simply reinforced some of the lessons that came out of the win in germany that was the catalyst for such a surge of optimism.\nEngland have some very exciting options up front in the shape of vardy and harry kane, while daniel sturridge also got a decent 57 minutes under his belt.\nQuestions remain, however, about a frail-looking defence with both full-back spots still up for grabs and no central-defensive pairing jumping out as hodgson's first choice at this stage.\nEngland certainly carry a threat but fears persist about their ability to resist attacks of the highest calibre.\nFraser forster: solid night for the southampton keeper despite a couple of fumbles.\nSaved well from georginio wijnaldum and vincent janssen.\nClear deputy to joe hart.\n7.\nKyle walker: solid and quick in defence and a threat in attack with a perfect pass for vardy to score england's goal.\n7.\nChris smalling: part of an uncertain central-defensive partnership that once again hinted at england's frailty against attacks possessing real quality.\n6.\nJohn stones: not a great night for everton's 21-year-old.\nYes, his determination to play started the move for england's goal but too often caused anxiety with his tendency to overdo things and second-half slip started chain of events that led to the dutch equaliser.\n5.\nDanny rose: not an easy night for england's defence but rose kept going and may consider himself unlucky to be punished for the handball that led to a penalty.\n6.\nJames milner: anonymous as england's captain.\nMilner is a solid presence but not big on inspirational moments.\n5.\nDanny drinkwater: solid debut from the leicester city midfielder.\nDid himself no harm and can be happy with his debut but did he make a compelling case for inclusion in euro 2016?\nNot sure.\n6.\nRoss barkley: busy first half and a trademark second-half surge that set up a chance for adam lallana.\n6.\nAdam lallana: decent night for the liverpool midfielder.\nClever pass played its part in england's goal and was warmly applauded when substituted.\n7.\nDaniel sturridge: once he'd stopped fiddling with his bootlaces he settled down and produced one or two moments that hint at the threat he could yet pose for england.\n6.\nJamie vardy: england's star man.\nBusy, scored one and could have had another.\n8.\nSubstitutes: walcott (for sturridge, 57 minutes): odd flash of pace and one rising shot over the bar but otherwise quiet.\n6.\nClyne (for rose, 57 minutes): not much of an opportunity and consequently not much impact.\n5.\nKane (for lallana, 70 minutes): just a couple of half-chances but no rescue act from the man who is now england's first-choice striker.\n5.\nJagielka (for smalling, 70 minutes): claimed he was fouled by janssen in the lead-up to the winner but should have been stronger in that situation.\n5.\nAlli (for milner, 82 minutes): no rating.\nDier (for drinkwater, 84 minutes): no rating.\nThe three lions wait until 21 may to host turkey, while netherlands meet republic of ireland six days later.\nMatch ends, england 1, netherlands 2.\nSecond half ends, england 1, netherlands 2.\nFoul by dele alli (england).\nIbrahim afellay (netherlands)

notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs

just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is

you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks [patient] okay sounds great thanks

might - be inclined to buy into it.\nIs he even thinking about it that way?\nYou would hope so, but it's unlikely.\nThere is so much to ponder.\nDoes scotland have to follow a slavish adherence to 4-2-3-1?\nCan a solution be found to the absence of dominant centre-backs by converting a full-back or a midfielder?\nMaybe not, but where are the ideas?\nWe saw a snapshot of strachan's out-of-the-box thinking when he played ikechi anya at right-back at wembley.\nWhat happens when kieran tierney and andrew robertson are both fit at left-back, along with lee wallace and stephen kingsley?\nIs it really one from four there?\nDoes it have to be that way?\nWhere's the innovation, the sense of a manager trying something a bit different?\nAnd what about an enhanced cast of characters on the scene?\nAberdeen's graeme shinnie, fulham's tom cairney, brighton's jamie murphy, aston villa's ross mccormack, stoke city's phil bardsley and, yes, if he ever starts playing and scoring again, middlesbrough's jordan rhodes.\nThere are others, either on the periphery of the squad or totally divorced from it, that could be looked at properly.\nToo often, strachan has been rigid in his thinking and it's done nothing for the team.\nThe tired mantra that \"the players are just not there\" is an entirely bogus argument when all that is being asked is that scotland become truly competitive, like northern ireland.\nThey have decent premier league centre-halves - from west brom, who sit 11th - and an impressive midfielder from southampton - who are 10th - but who have precious little else in terms of quality and, most especially, depth.\nAnd yet, from a squad largely made up of championship, league one and scottish premiership players, northern ireland get the kind of results that are beyond scotland.\nThe attitude of \"no manager could do better with these players\" is fatalism.\nIt's tantamount to a white flag being raised.\nA quitter's charter, the central tenet of which is blown to the high heavens by what michael o'neill is doing with his meagre resources in belfast.\nThe sfa's statement on thursday did nothing to challenge the view that a blind faith - or a meek acceptance of failure -  has taken an ever firmer hold of hampden.\nWhen they can't get a draw against georgia, can't beat lithuania and can't avoid a drubbing against a moderate team like slovakia, the idea of scotland suddenly morphing into a points machine is a hard sell.\nScotland took the most affordable option, but a dwindling number of supporters would agree that it was the best one.", "summary": "The Scottish Football Association (SFA) made a statement on Thursday regarding the resignation of Gordon Strachan as national team manager, but did not mention money or the cost of finding replacements.

seven years .\nBut i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .\n[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .\n[patient] okay , that's reassuring .\n[doctor] yeah .\nSo what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having .\nAnd then i'll do a quick exam .\n[patient] okay .\nThat sounds good .\n[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails .\nAnd , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?\n[patient] i have blue cross blue shield .\nWell , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .\n[doctor] okay .\nWhat we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company .\nAnd what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not .\nBut we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance .\nDo you know when you'll be on the new plan ?\n[patient] most likely july .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?\n[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years .\nI do have a lotta pain here and here .\nBut i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not .\nIt gets painful and builds up .\nSo i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd in your neck and your upper back .\nAnd how long has this been going on ?\nWould you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?\n[patient] i would say since i was in high school .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ?\nUm , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .\n[patient] yes .\nI do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often .\nI mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable .\nAnd the others are expensive in my size .\n[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well .\nAnd , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?\n[patient] no , i do not have any kids now .\nBut we might plan to in the future .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?\n[patient] sometimes , yes .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ?\nAnd , and it could be from sweating .\n[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?\n[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running .\nAnd it hurts .\n[doctor] and it hurts , okay .\nAnd , and you saw a chiropractor .\nBut what about physical therapy for your back pain ?\nOr do you take any pain medicine for it ?\n[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .\n[doctor] that's okay .\nSo let's see .\nI know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family .\nHave you had any mammograms ?\nAnd how old was your mother when she had it ?\n[patient] mom was 40 .\nAnd they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram .\nI'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 .\nSo i'm still a little bit young .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?\n[patient] yes , for the most part .\nI lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .\n[doctor] congratulations .\nThat's great .\nAnd then , um- [patient] thank you .\n[doctor] .\nSo then ... you're welcome .\nAnd so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ?\nAnd then , um , you said that you were going to school .\nWhat are you going to school for ?\n[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .\n[doctor] okay , that's great .\nAll right .\nSo what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look .\nI'm gon na take a couple of measurements .\nAnd we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards .\nUm , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia .\nOkay .\nSo , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] okay .\nWell , thank you so much .\nIt looks like i have all the measurements that we need .\nYou can go ahead and cover up now .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction .\nWhen we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .\n[patient] okay .\nThat's fine .\n[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .\n[patient] right .", "summary": "A patient, Julia Jones, is seeking a breast

for a few weeks now [patient] yeah it was i was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know i was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just has n't been going away [doctor] okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before [patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so [doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not [patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it [doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go [patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain [doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also [patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so [doctor] okay [patient] of course [doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that [patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it [doctor] okay and does that seem to help or [patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit [doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and [patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift [doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then [patient] yeah [doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or [patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of [doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven .\nEight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan [patient] no that sounds good [doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay [patient] sounds great [doctor] okay thanks [patient] thanks [doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or [patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but [doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that [patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good", "summary": "A patient, Bobby, visited a doctor with complaints of right shoulder pain that has been persisting for a

to crops if left untreated.\nUsually, if you want to study an animal, you do a survey and count it.\nThe problem with slugs is you can't always see them as they spend much of their time out of sight in the top 10cm (4in) of the ground.\nBut improved tracking technology will allow scientists to accurately follow slug movements for the first time.\nThe aim of the research is to answer an interesting problem facing farmers: how do slugs live amongst their crops?\nThe researchers at harper adams university have a theory slugs are not evenly distributed over a field.\nInstead they believe they are concentrated in patches.\nThat's important because if the scientists could help farmers find these large patches of slugs you could target them with pest control measures.\nThat would be cheaper and greener than spreading chemicals over an entire field.\nSlugs are slimy and enjoy squeezing into tight spaces so the trackers need to be placed inside the slugs themselves just under the skin.\nThe slugs are anaesthetised before a small cut is made in the skin and the tracker inserted.\nThe tracker itself is smaller than a grain of rice.\nThe slugs i saw were implanted a month ago and seemed happy.\nIt's important to the researchers that the trackers don't cause the slugs to behave any differently to their non-implanted cousins.\nIn the lab it appears neither slug movement or appetite is affected.\nTracking the slugs involves equipment that looks very like a metal detector.\nResearchers will go out at night when the slugs are most active and release the slugs with the trackers.\nThere will be hundreds of them over the duration of the experiment.\nThen every 20 minutes throughout the night the team will scan the fields with the detector.\nThis will automatically log the slug's individual tracker number and it's gps location building up a very accurate map of where the slugs go and what they are doing.\nThere's increasing pressure on farmers to reduce the chemicals they use against slugs and some are being banned outright.\nSo if this research comes up with a better way to control them by revealing more about their behaviour it could be very useful.\nFunding for this study has come from the agriculture and horticulture development board (ahdb), the potato council and cereals and oilseeds who estimate that slugs could cause \u00e2\u00a3100m of damage to uk crops if they aren't properly controlled.\nAnd finally a confession.\nWe did take a slug out into the field and we put it down on the ground to track it.\nWe certainly managed to find it again, the signal from its tracker was loud and strong, but we couldn't actually see it.\nWhich means we couldn't recover the slug and he had to go and join his colleagues in the soil.\nIt did rather show how trackers beat traditional visual slug surveys.\nAnd soon our slug implanted with a tracker will be joined by hundreds more.\nUpdate: one week on and our slug was safely recovered by the team.", "summary": "Scientists at Harper Adams University are fitting tracking devices to slugs to learn more about their behaviour to benefit farmers dealing with slug damage to

international sport today should be looking at russian sport and looking at whether the men and women who compete in their events are clean.\"\n\"they do not have robust anti-doping regimes.\nThey are asleep on the job - and they have to be rooted out.\"\nWada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in russian athletics, also implicated the international association of athletics' federations.\nThe iaaf's former president lamine diack has been provisionally suspended by the international olympic committee, who have also asked the iaaf to start disciplinary action against the athletes named in the report.\nAraf has been told to respond to the report by friday and russia have defended their position.\nActing head of russia athletics

will work more closely with wada, igor zagorskiy, deputy director of the russian anti-doping agency, rusada, told the bbc: \"there is always room for improvement.\n\"we are on that track and we've

problem.\nHe revealed that he had spoken to iaaf president lord coe since monday's publication of wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in russian athletics, and also implicated the iaaf.\nThe 323-page report said that \"acceptance of cheating at all levels is widespread\" in russia and suggested that neither araf, rusada, nor the russian federation can be considered anti-doping code-compliant.\nThe report also said the london 2012 olympics were \"sabotaged\" by \"widespread inaction\" against athletes with suspicious doping profiles; accuses moscow laboratory director grigory rodchenko of asking for and accepting bribes and intentionally destroying samples he was told to keep; and recommends that five russian athletes and five coaches should be given lifetime doping bans.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device pound, who chaired the wada investigation, said the situation was \"worse than we thought\", adding that \"it may be a residue of the old soviet union system\".\nWarner backed the recommendation to suspend russia from competition \"until they put their house in order\", adding: \"if you punish one or two innocent russian athletes for the greater good of the sport, that is a moral dilemma i am willing to grasp.\"\nHe also suggested that russia is unlikely to be the only country guilty of doping, saying that \"athletics has probably got some other nations to root out\".\nHe added that while \"there are undoubtedly drugs cheats in many corners of athletics\", he believed systemic doping did not occur in nations in the western world.\nDuring a special bbc radio 5 live programme examining the independent report, britain's marathon world record holder paula radcliffe said: \"i don't think anyone is under the impression it's only russia.\"\nOn the same programme, former british sprinter darren campbell warned of \"darker days to come\".\nHe said: \"this report was about russia, and they need to be punished if this holds up, but we'll lose sight on the bigger issues if we focus on russia.\nIt's about cleaning everything out.\n\"there's people talking about testing out

change has to happen now.\"\nCoe, elected iaaf president in august, described the wada report as \"alarming\" and has said he will seek urgent approval from members to consider sanctions against the russian federation.\nThe report found evidence of multiple rules breaches by iaaf officials and found the governing body to be \"inexplicably lax in following up suspicious blood (and other) profiles\".\nMedia playback is not supported on this device it has also been criticised for its handling of the allegations, with coe himself describing claims about suspicious blood profiles involving some athletes as \"a declaration of war on my sport\" in august.\nOn monday, coe said that \"if there are failings in our governance or our anti-doping programme i will fix them\".\nBut warner says coe needs to restructure the iaaf in order for it to effectively tackle the problem.\n\"this cannot be a one-man crusade,\" warner told bbc radio 4's today programme.\n\"he needs to ensure there is a bench around him at the iaaf who dramatically improve the operation.\n\"we all know, and he has already said, he needs to go out and hire a good chief executive.\n\"it needs more than that.\nHe also possibly needs a chairman under him so he can take the lead of the elected council and be the ambassador for the sport and have full-time professional staff, possibly from outside

seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor]

pain , then we could try a cortisone injection .\n[patient] i like the idea of starting with the physical therapy and have a next step if it does n't help .\nI am not opposed to a shot but would like to try the therapy first .\n[doctor] all right .\nGreat .\nI'll get a referral order , and they will call you within the next day or two to get you scheduled .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] mm-hmm

you .\n[doctor] all right .\nSo , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now .\nOften sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away .\nBut , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time .\nUm , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough .\nIf he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe .\nSo , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine .\n[doctor] you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] actually , i will .\nI'll go ahead and just give you some as well .\n[patient_guest] okay .\nOkay .\n[doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it .\nIt only works for the barky cough .\n[patient_guest] mm-hmm , got it .\n[doctor] okay .\nWe'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week .\nSo , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough .\nHe can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age .\nSo , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it

.\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how many days ago was that ?\n[patient] that was about six days ago now .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd what have you taken for the pain ?\n[patient] i've been taking ibuprofen .\nUm , and then i've been putting some heat on it .\nBut it's still pretty stiff .\n[doctor] okay .\nAll right .\nUm , and did you have any trauma before that happened ?\nWere you doing anything strenuous like crossfit or lifting boxes or anything like that before you went for , for the walk ?\n[patient] i have been lifting more , um , probably around three times a week .\nSo i do n't know if it was because i was doing deadlifts that day and then walked .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] um , maybe i was using my back more than my legs .\n[doctor] okay .\nAll right .\nAnd was it any particular area in

know , everything looks good .\nYou know , on your heart exam , i do hear that slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur , but you've had that before .\nThat seems stable to me .\nOn your back exam , you do have some pain to palpation on the right lateral aspect of your lumbar spine , and you do have pain with flexion and extension as well , and you have a negative straight leg raise .\nSo

seems like something is always stuck in my throat and you know just i kinda go about my day and it kinda bothers me you know a little bit sometimes a little painful and when i try to eat it just seems like i have to i do n't know when it's something solid i kinda have to wash it down on occasion i i've never really fully choked but i have to admit that i've thought about potentially choking [doctor] okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing [patient] no coughing just kinda when i swallow it's all okay with liquids but when i kinda swallow you know like a bite of a sandwich sometimes it just feels like like i just need a little help pushing it down [doctor] okay and is it more kind of a like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that [patient] i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think it's probably more with solids [doctor] okay how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids is there is there a temperature change any modification to that [patient] it's really just about solids [doctor] okay alright so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all [patient] no [doctor] okay that so no vomiting blood no coughing up blood or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all [patient] not that i want [doctor] okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this [patient] no [doctor] okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven .\nFour we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going [patient] i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise [doctor] okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all [patient] yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time [doctor] and how are the numbers looking [patient] they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting [doctor] okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that [patient] no [doctor] okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home [patient] i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range [doctor] okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or

have any issues certainly call me but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that did we forget anything or do you need refills for anything [patient] you know i think i'm low on the

about twenty years ago [doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here [patient] okay [doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit [patient] okay that's painful [doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that [patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time [doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year [patient] okay okay [doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour [patient]

barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks

horses and i i bought you know four hundred bills a day and when i spent a day loading it and then it's i just started coughing a lot more i think around that time and after that i i i just got a cold so that's what sent me to my pcp now i i i do exercise i i do a lot of biking and i typically do n't get sick and my cough has gone away [doctor] okay that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking i love to bike myself i've got a track seventy one hundred hybrid have you been on the the new trails they opened it was the old the old rail the old rail road right away they've opened that up it's like sixty miles of trails [patient] i love that that road i just i i do n't like riding on the road so i prefer to do those rails the trails type [doctor] yeah [patient] and it's just so phenomenal i do that a lot [doctor] yeah i love riding over there way we will we will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride [patient] absolutely i'd love it [doctor] that'd be great so i see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time and and and what do you do to to take care of your ra [patient] yeah it's it's it's fair you know arthritis never really goes away but i take methotrexate [doctor] okay [patient] i think it's seven and a half milligrams every week and as long as i'm keeping active my joints feel okay and if i do have any problems it's it's mostly with my hands but i have n't had any recent flares so i'm okay right now [doctor] okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking [patient] i stopped smoking probably about seven years ago [doctor] okay [patient] and i was young and should have stopped the way before that my kids were on me all the time but you know i i got a new start and finally was able to stop and i felt better after stopping [doctor] okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that [patient] no not at all [doctor] okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies [patient] no lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer but she is doing well now [doctor] okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that [patient] no no not not anything that i'm aware

can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of

it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three

then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been

asthma and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all [patient] hmmm hmmm [doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that [patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me [doctor] okay [patient] so i do n't try to go there often [doctor] okay thank you for

in to see me today ?\n[patient] well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have , or really even what it is .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo how long have you had that for ?\nDo you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ?\n[patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur .\nSo of course , i'm worried as well .\n[doctor] got it .\nOkay .\nAnd are you having any symptoms at all ?\n[patient] i do n't think so .\nI do n't know what symptoms i should be having .\n[doctor] okay .\nWell , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one .\nSo i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?\n[patient] no , i definitely do n't .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?\n[patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain .\nUm , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs .\n[doctor] okay , got it , for the legs .\nAnd do you feel short of breath at all ?\n[patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?\n[patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know .\nMaybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .\n[doctor] got it .\nAll right .\n[patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all .\nUm , maybe more if i try to overdo it .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though .\n[doctor] okay , got it .\nAnd so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?\n[patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago .\nBefore that i did n't notice anything at all .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?\n[patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?\n[patient] yeah .\nSo i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd so how about any passing out at all ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay , good .\nAnd how about irregular heartbeats ?\nDo you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?\n[patient] i do n't notice it at all .\n[doctor] okay , great .\nAnd how about any swelling in the legs at all ?\n[patient] yeah , my ankles swell .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how long has this been going on ?\n[patient] um , i would say for probably six months .\nBut it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?\n[patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\nOkay .\n[patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] good .\nSo mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur .\nIs that right ?\nAnd sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?\n[patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd so fatigue as well .\nAnd have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?\n[patient] i'm not really sure .\n[doctor] okay .\nIt does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?\n[patient] yeah , you name it .\n[doctor] all right .\nWell , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record .\nUm , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ?\nAll right .\nGot them .\nAnd then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay , good .\nAnd looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack .\nIs that correct ?\n[patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .\n[doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment .\n[patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke .\nBut that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .\n[doctor] okay , i see .\n[patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .\n[doctor] okay .\nAll right .\nWell , it looks like also that you never smoked .\nThat's excellent .\nAnd then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?\n[patient] correct .\n[doctor] all right .\nWell , let's do a quick exam .\n[patient] all right .\nSounds good .\n[doctor] all right .\nWell , for physical exam , please use the regular template .\nAll right , please just breathe normally .\nGreat .\nAnd now take a few deep breaths for me .\nAll right .\nDo you feel okay ?\nAre you feeling any dizziness or anything ?\n[patient] no , i feel fine .\n[doctor] okay , great .\nAll right .\nWell , that is it for the exam .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right .\nSo what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram .\nIt's a very common test and it just

findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay alright so on your heart exam your heart sounds in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation and remind me what knee did you injure again [patient] my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay so on your right knee examination i do appreciate some edema and an effusion over the right knee does it hurt when i press [patient] yes [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right lateral knee there is decreased flexion and extension there is a positive lachman sign there is a palpable palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is no leg edema in the ankle okay well let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and

your anterior cruciate ligament that's like a major ligament that helps connect and helps your knee move back and forth so i wan na go ahead and order a knee mri just so that we can get a a a good look and just you know confirm that physical exam okay now some people can have a normal physical exam and their acl can still be torn but you do have a lot of pain on the lateral aspect of your knee so i wan na make sure if there make sure that there is not any other structures that have been damaged by this accident okay i wan na go ahead and you know are you what are you taking for the pain [patient] ibuprofen [doctor] is that helping [patient] somewhat yes [doctor] okay alright do you want something stronger [patient] no i'm okay [doctor] alright so let's just continue with ibuprofen you can take you know six hundred to eight hundred milligrams every eight hours as needed i wan na go ahead and put you in a brace that's gon na help your knee feel a bit more supported okay and let's go ahead and i'm hoping that we can get this mri done in you know the next couple days and then we can have a conversation about what needs to be done now you said that you are are are you know obviously a very active active mom any other exercise or anything else that that i should be aware of that you do just wondering in terms of which kind of graft we would use to fix this with your with your acl being injured [patient] hmmm no i not i i would like to get back to the running but currently not that active [doctor] okay alright alright do you have any questions about anything [patient]

accuses moscow laboratory director grigory rodchenko of asking for and accepting bribes and intentionally destroying samples he was told to keep; and recommends that five russian athletes and five coaches should be given lifetime doping bans.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device pound, who chaired the wada investigation, said the situation was \"worse than we thought\", adding that \"it may be a residue of the old soviet union system\".\nWarner backed the recommendation to suspend russia from competition \"until they put their house in order\", adding: \"if you punish one or two innocent russian athletes for the greater good of the sport, that is a moral dilemma i am willing to grasp.\"\nHe also suggested that russia is unlikely to be the only country guilty of doping, saying that \"athletics has probably got some other nations to root out\".\nHe added that while \"there are undoubtedly drugs cheats in many corners of athletics\", he believed systemic doping did not occur in nations in the western world.\nDuring a special bbc radio 5 live programme examining the independent report, britain's marathon world record holder paula radcliffe said: \"i don't think anyone is under the impression it's only russia.\"\nOn the same programme, former british sprinter darren campbell warned of \"darker days to come\".\nHe said: \"this report was about russia, and they need to be punished if this holds up, but we'll lose sight on the bigger issues if we focus on russia.\nIt's about cleaning everything out.\n\"there's people talking about testing out in kenya and jamaica.\nWe can't have rumours anymore.\n\"we need to understand how the russians got away with it.\nHow did this happen yet nobody knew?\n\"no matter how dark and depressing it gets, change has to happen now.\"\nCoe, elected iaaf president in august, described the wada report as \"alarming\" and has said he will seek urgent approval from members to consider sanctions against the russian federation.\nThe report found evidence of multiple rules breaches by iaaf officials and found the governing body to be \"inexplicably lax in following up suspicious blood (and other) profiles\".\nMedia playback is not supported on this device it has also been criticised for its handling of the allegations, with coe himself describing claims about suspicious blood profiles involving some athletes as \"a declaration of war on my sport\" in august.\nOn monday, coe said that \"if there are failings in our governance or our anti-doping programme i will fix them\".\nBut warner says coe needs to restructure the iaaf in order for it to effectively tackle the problem.\n\"this cannot be a one-man crusade,\" warner told bbc radio 4's today programme.\n\"he needs to ensure there is a bench around him at the iaaf who dramatically improve the operation.\n\"we all know, and he has already said, he needs to go out and hire a good chief executive.\n\"it needs more than that.\nHe also possibly needs a chairman under him so he can take the lead of the elected council and be the ambassador for the sport and have full-time professional staff, possibly from outside sport, from elsewhere in business, who can get a grip on the organisation.\"", "summary": "Ed Warner, the chairman of UK Athletics, stated that Russia is not the only country where systemic doping is an issue and believes that four to six countries may have problems in track and field.

doing okay but i've had this wound on my right foot for a couple of weeks and it's not getting better i saw my pcp and they referred me to you i i used to see a podiatrist and a couple of years ago but they moved and i was n't able to get another one [doctor] okay and how long have you had the wound [patient] about two to three weeks [doctor] okay have you had any kind of trauma to that foot [patient] no i bought a new pair of shoes to travel with and the neuropathy i guess i did n't feel that they were too tight at first it was just a blister but it looked a lot worse now i've been putting a band-aid on it and [doctor] okay and so did your doctor put you on any antibiotics when they they saw your foot [patient] yes i finished the course yesterday the wound looked about the same though [doctor] okay now does it hurt [patient] no i ca n't feel it [doctor] okay now have you had any other symptoms like fever chills drainage from the wound or anything along those lines [patient] no but when i take my sock off sometimes it sticks to the wound even when i put a band-aid on [doctor] okay well are you still wearing those same shoes that cause the problem [patient] no i'm upset [doctor] i'm so upset too i love those shoes [patient] no i'm so upset i i love those shoes [doctor] okay so what kind of shoes are they [patient] they're hoka's [doctor] ah so where did you get them [patient] i got them at rei couple of years ago [doctor] they're pretty good about helping you to fit your fit you in a shoe are n't they [patient] yeah [doctor] so what do you like about them [patient] they are comfortable they are easy to take on and off and they provide good stability [doctor] that's good so you've had some issues with stability sometimes or [patient] yes [doctor] okay

quick physical exam okay for vital signs your temperature is ninety eight .\nOne your vital signs look good your heart rate is seventy two respirations sixteen blood pressure is one ten over sixty five okay so on your foot exam let's see there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot it is just proximal to the right fifth to the fifth mtp joint and there is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue there's no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there's no evidence of fluid collection there's no necrosis there is no odor i do not appreciate any bony exposure on on vascular exam there are palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses there are no palpable dp or pt pulses but doppler signs are present okay so does this hurt when i touch it here [patient] no it's okay [doctor] okay alright so i've reviewed the results your right foot x-ray that we did before you i came in the room and this shows no evidence of osteomyelitis which means there is no evidence of bone infection so that's really good so let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem your diabetic foot ulcer so i want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to your foot to see if you can heal this wound i'm also gon na perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue and then next i'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and i want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area okay so i do n't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see you again in two weeks so we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay [patient] okay [doctor] okay so for your diabetes it's gon na be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal so we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without a being too much but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin a1c into a little bit better level okay [patient] okay [doctor] alright do you have

i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse [doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there [patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time [doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version [patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden [doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at [patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month [doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes [patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here [doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me [patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg [doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life [patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten [doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better [patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down [doctor] okay [patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today [doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs [patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well [doctor] that's okay [patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day [doctor] absolutely [patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them [doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here [patient] no it's right here [doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there [patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks [doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please [patient] okay that's it that's all i got [doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural

right shoulder pain that you've had for a few weeks now [patient] yeah it was i was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know i was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just has n't been going away [doctor] okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before [patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so [doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not [patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it [doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go [patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain [doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also [patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so [doctor] okay [patient] of course [doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that [patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it [doctor] okay and does that seem to help or [patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit [doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and [patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift [doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then [patient] yeah [doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or [patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of [doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven .\nEight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan [patient] no that sounds good [doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay [patient] sounds great [doctor] okay thanks [patient] thanks [doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or [patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but [doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that [patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good", "summary": "Bobby, a patient, visits the doctor complaining

\u00a32.5bn) to improve life in a number of african countries.\nThis in addition to the \u20ac20bn it already gives in aid to africa.\nSomalia's distinctly unimpressed prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke put it to the bbc that africa needed investment, not charity, to improve its economies.\nThe same as the us, the eu or anywhere else in the world, he said.\nIn fact, eu countries couldn't even muster the pledged extra cash.\nIt's a promise they seem unable or unwilling to keep.\nThe european commission says it will put in \u20ac1.8bn and wants the rest of the new fund made up by individual european nations.\nSo far they've coughed up less than \u20ac80m.\nThe eu was also unable to persuade/charm - some say bully - african countries into automatically receiving deported migrants back.\nInstead, in the written summit conclusions, the eu was forced to emphasise \"voluntary repatriations\".\nThat prompted obvious questions about the bloc's declared aim of \"speeding up the return\" of economic migrants and other failed asylum seekers - a key part of its plan to tackle the migrant crisis.\nIn short: the summit was not a resounding success.\nAnd a number of european newspapers were critical of the eu even trying to make a deal.\nGermany's sueddeutsche zeitung says the eu's offer of money to reduce the refugee numbers from africa could open the eu to accusations of \"showing its real values by co-operating with unjust regimes\".\nSimilar objections are raised when it comes to eu attempts to strike a deal with turkey - now the main departure point for refugees and other migrants crossing to europe.\nEu leaders are planning a turkey summit before the end of the year, but - as german chancellor angela merkel has pointed out - \"ankara holds the cards\".\nAnd diplomats worry that ankara will demand an extravagant bouquet in terms of money and political concessions - such as lifting visa restrictions, and accelerating turkey's eu membership bid - in exchange for help on migration.\nAnd again, critics challenge the eu for courting turkey at all - a country with an imperious president and dismal human rights record.\nThere are also those who say the eu's focus is far too fixed on creating \"fortress europe\", on keeping people out and not on introducing legal ways for them to come to over.\nBecause come they will.\nThe european commission expects about three million refugees and other migrants to arrive in europe by 2017.\nClearly, whatever the eu does during this crisis, it will come under fire from some quarter or another.\nAll too often, it comes up against itself - a behemoth of 28 nations, struggling to work together.\nEven the quota system - accepted (reluctantly) by most eu countries - to share out more equally the asylum seekers in europe is an unmitigated flop so far.\nAgreed number of people to be relocated: 160,000.\nPeople moved to date: 147.\nCross-border co-operation is disintegrating as barbed wire goes up and borders slam shut across europe: in slovenia, hungary, austria, sweden, norway\u2026 even germany is toughening border regulations.\nIn stark contrast to the warm welcome given to hundreds or thousands earlier this autumn, wolfgang schaeuble, germany's hugely popular finance minister, has begun to mutter darkly about a migrant \"avalanche\" engulfing his country.\nThere's little evidence of the eu - more of each country for itself.\nThat prompted the president of the european council, donald tusk, to warn that schengen, the eu agreement allowing passport-free travel across much of europe, risks collapse.\nYet it is one of the eu's proudest achievements.\nYou could argue schengen has already wilted and died.", "summary": "The European Union is struggling to cope with the large influx of refugees and migrants arriving in Europe.

do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend [doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me [patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe [doctor] okay [patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah [doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain [patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot [doctor] okay [patient] let me separate these [doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area [patient] no nothing

physical exam on you here [patient] okay [doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit [patient] okay that's painful [doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that [patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time [doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year [patient] okay okay [doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour [patient] okay [doctor] okay [patient] alright sounds good [doctor]

fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride [patient] absolutely i'd love it [doctor] that'd be great so i see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time and and and what do you do to to take care of your ra [patient] yeah it's it's it's fair you know arthritis never really goes away but i take methotrexate [doctor] okay [patient] i think it's seven and a half milligrams every week and as long as i'm keeping active my joints feel okay and if i do have any problems it's it's mostly with my hands but i have n't had any recent flares so i'm okay right now [doctor] okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking [patient] i stopped smoking probably about seven years ago [doctor] okay [patient] and i was young and should have stopped the way before that my kids were on me all the time but you know i i got a new start and finally was able to stop and i felt better after stopping [doctor] okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that [patient] no not at all [doctor] okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies [patient] no lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer but she is doing well now [doctor] okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that [patient] no no not not anything that i'm aware of [doctor] okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process [patient] no i do n't think so i think i'll be okay i'm scared [doctor] i i know you're scared but we'll be right here with you the whole way [patient] okay [doctor] alright we'll get some paperwork and i'll see you again in a few minutes [patient] okay thank you", "summary": "A patient, Kyle, has been referred to a doctor for an

might - be inclined to buy into it.\nIs he even thinking about it that way?\nYou would hope so, but it's unlikely.\nThere is so much to ponder.\nDoes scotland have to follow a slavish adherence to 4-2-3-1?\nCan a solution be found to the absence of dominant centre-backs by converting a full-back or a midfielder?\nMaybe not, but where are the ideas?\nWe saw a snapshot of strachan's out-of-the-box thinking when he played ikechi anya at right-back at wembley.\nWhat happens when kieran tierney and andrew robertson are both fit at left-back, along with lee wallace and stephen kingsley?\nIs it really one from four there?\nDoes it have to be that way?\nWhere's the innovation, the sense of a manager trying something a bit different?\nAnd what about an enhanced cast of characters on the scene?\nAberdeen's graeme shinnie, fulham's tom cairney, brighton's jamie murphy, aston villa's ross mccormack, stoke city's phil bardsley and, yes, if he ever starts playing and scoring again, middlesbrough's jordan rhodes.\nThere are others, either on the periphery of the squad or totally divorced from it, that could be looked at properly.\nToo often, strachan has been rigid in his thinking and it's done nothing for the team.\nThe tired mantra that \"the players are just not there\" is an entirely bogus argument when all that is being asked is that scotland become truly competitive, like northern ireland.\nThey have decent premier league centre-halves - from west brom, who sit 11th - and an impressive midfielder from southampton - who are 10th - but who have precious little else in terms of quality and, most especially, depth.\nAnd yet, from a squad largely made up of championship, league one and scottish premiership players, northern ireland get the kind of results that are beyond scotland.\nThe attitude of \"no manager could do better with these players\" is fatalism.\nIt's tantamount to a white flag being raised.\nA quitter's charter, the central tenet of which is blown to the high heavens by what michael o'neill is doing with his meagre resources in belfast.\nThe sfa's statement on thursday did nothing to challenge the view that a blind faith - or a meek acceptance of failure -  has taken an ever firmer hold of hampden.\nWhen they can't get a draw against georgia, can't beat lithuania and can't avoid a drubbing against a moderate team like slovakia, the idea of scotland suddenly morphing into a points machine is a hard sell.\nScotland took the most affordable option, but a dwindling number of supporters would agree that it was the best one.", "summary": "The Scottish Football Association (SFA) has decided to keep Gordon Strachan as the national team manager, despite the team's poor performance in the World Cup qualifiers.

kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since [doctor] okay so that was about five days ago then [patient] yeah yeah that was last weekend [doctor] last weekend okay now which knee is it [patient] it's my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened [patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards [doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance [patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore [doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before [patient] no that was the first time [doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake [patient] lake martin [doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier [patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can [doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day [patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway [doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked [patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days [doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing [patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it [doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all [patient] no just the swelling and the pain [doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain [patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day [doctor] okay and [patient] putting a cold pack on it [doctor] okay and has that helped at all [patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though [doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here [patient] i had my tonsils out [doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press [patient] yeah that's sore [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt [patient] yeah do n't do that anymore [doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that [patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan [doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions [patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me [doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye [patient]

getting ready for the next season that starts in in april and we were at the courts plan and i went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers i guess he could say and so he he found me while i was going for a lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen [doctor] yeah [patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym [doctor] okay [patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so [doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way [patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys [doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad [patient] yeah yes [doctor]

trouble walking at all [patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid [doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable [patient] yeah [doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches [patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach [doctor] great [patient] starting in april so [doctor] alright well [patient] how long [doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again [patient] okay [doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly [patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so

.\nOkay .\nAnd are you having any symptoms at all ?\n[patient] i do n't think so .\nI do n't know what symptoms i should be having .\n[doctor] okay .\nWell , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one .\nSo i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?\n[patient] no , i definitely do n't .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?\n[patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain .\nUm , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs .\n[doctor] okay , got it , for the legs .\nAnd do you feel short of breath at all ?\n[patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?\n[patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know .\nMaybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .\n[doctor] got it .\nAll right .\n[patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all .\nUm , maybe more if i try to overdo it .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though .\n[doctor] okay , got it .\nAnd so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?\n[patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago .\nBefore that i did n't notice anything at all .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?\n[patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?\n[patient] yeah .\nSo i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd so how about any passing out at all ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay , good .\nAnd how about irregular heartbeats ?\nDo you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?\n[patient] i do n't notice it at all .\n[doctor] okay , great .\nAnd how about any swelling in the legs at all ?\n[patient] yeah , my ankles swell .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how long has this been going on ?\n[patient] um , i would say for probably six months .\nBut it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?\n[patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\nOkay .\n[patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] good .\nSo mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur .\nIs that right ?\nAnd sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?\n[patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd so fatigue as well .\nAnd have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?\n[patient] i'm not really sure .\n[doctor] okay .\nIt does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?\n[patient] yeah , you name it .\n[doctor] all right .\nWell , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record .\nUm , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ?\nAll right .\nGot them .\nAnd then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay , good .\nAnd looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack .\nIs that correct ?\n[patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .\n[doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment .\n[patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke .\nBut that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .\n[doctor] okay , i see .\n[patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .\n[doctor] okay .\nAll right .\nWell , it looks like also that you never smoked .\nThat's excellent .\nAnd then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?\n[patient] correct .\n[doctor] all right .\nWell , let's do a quick exam .\n[patient] all right .\nSounds good .\n[doctor] all right .\nWell , for physical exam , please use the regular template .\nAll right , please just breathe normally .\nGreat .\nAnd now take a few deep breaths for me .\nAll right .\nDo you feel okay ?\nAre you feeling any dizziness or anything ?\n[patient] no , i feel fine .\n[doctor] okay , great .\nAll right .\nWell , that is it for the exam .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right .\nSo what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram .\nIt's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart .\nAnd it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working .\n[patient] okay .", "summary": "A 100-year-old woman, Diana Scott, visits a doctor for a new patient note.

"England failed to build on the optimism generated by their thrilling victory in germany as they were beaten in a friendly by the netherlands, who have not even qualified for euro 2016.\nOn a night when wembley paid its respects to the late dutch legend johan cruyff with applause in the 14th minute, a much-changed england side slipped to a rare defeat at the national stadium.\nMan-of-the-match jamie vardy rounded off a slick passing move to steer in kyle walker's cross four minutes before the interval - but roy hodgson's side could not protect their lead.\nEngland's defence lived on the edge too often and were eventually punished when a sloppy passage of play led to danny rose handling, and vincent janssen scored from the spot after 50 minutes.\nThe big striker was then too strong for substitute phil jagielka, although england complained bitterly he had been fouled, before crossing for luciano narsingh to score the winner 13 minutes from  time.\nVardy's transition from the heights he has scaled with leicester city this season to england has been seamless - and he has stepped up a level in the two friendlies against germany and the netherlands.\nThe 29-year-old has been portrayed as both an ideal starter and the perfect impact substitute as hodgson makes plans for euro 2016.\nVardy has proved his capabilities for both, with an explosive 20-minute cameo in berlin that included a brilliantly instinctive finish as part of england's comeback.\nAnd here, he was england's outstanding performer by some distance, showing the pace and energy that has panicked premier league defences and also skill to round off that passing move with a clinical finish before testing dutch keeper jeroen zoet with a powerful rising drive.\nThe debate about how best to use vardy may go on but one thing is beyond dispute - he is going to euro 2016 and has the ability to threaten every defence in france.\nIn an ideal world, everton's john stones would have come in at wembley to produce the sort of elegant display that became his trademark in the early seasons of his career, thus cementing his place alongside chris smalling for england's first euro 2016 game against russia in marseille.\nInstead, wembley witnessed a 21-year-old whose confidence has been hit by a recent dip in form at club level and will need a little renovating before the serious action gets under way.\nStones twice brought murmurs of concern from england's fans inside wembley with his tendency to perhaps over-play out of defence, but his determination to be constructive also started the passing move that led to vardy's goal.\nThe young defender is a work in progress and there will be slips - quite literally when he stumbled at the start of a chain of events that led to england keeper fraser forster having to save well from janssen before rose handled to leave the striker to score from the spot.\nStones is well worth persevering with - but hodgson must hope some of that confidence and composure returns quickly.\nHodgson warned they must not get carried away after victory in germany - and, in case anyone ignored the warning, along comes a defeat against a dutch team that will not even be in france this summer.\nIn some respects this defeat, albeit with a much-changed side, simply reinforced some of the lessons that came out of the win in germany that was the catalyst for such a surge of optimism.\nEngland have some very exciting options up front in the shape of vardy and harry kane, while daniel sturridge also got a decent 57 minutes under his belt.\nQuestions remain, however, about a frail-looking defence with both full-back spots still up for grabs and no central-defensive pairing jumping out as hodgson's first choice at this stage.\nEngland certainly carry a threat but fears persist about their ability to resist attacks of the highest calibre.\nFraser forster: solid night for the southampton keeper despite a couple of fumbles.\nSaved well from georginio wijnaldum and vincent janssen.\nClear deputy to joe hart.\n7.\nKyle walker: solid and quick in defence and a threat in attack with a perfect pass for vardy to score england's goal.\n7.\nChris smalling: part of an uncertain central-defensive partnership that once again hinted at england's frailty against attacks possessing real quality.\n6.\nJohn stones: not a great night for everton's 21-year-old.\nYes, his determination to play started the move for england's goal but too often caused anxiety with his tendency to overdo things and second-half slip started chain of events that led to the dutch equaliser.\n5.\nDanny rose: not an easy night for england's defence but rose kept going and may consider himself unlucky to be punished for the handball that led to a penalty.\n6.\nJames milner: anonymous as england's captain.\nMilner is a solid presence but not big on inspirational moments.\n5.\nDanny drinkwater: solid debut from the leicester city midfielder.\nDid himself no harm and can be happy with his debut but did he make a compelling case for inclusion in euro 2016?\nNot sure.\n6.\nRoss barkley: busy first half and a trademark second-half surge that set up a chance for adam lallana.\n6.\nAdam lallana: decent night for the liverpool midfielder.\nClever pass played its part in england's goal and was warmly applauded when substituted.\n7.\nDaniel sturridge: once he'd stopped fiddling with his bootlaces he settled down and produced one or two moments that hint at the threat he could yet pose for england.\n6.\nJamie vardy: england's star man.\nBusy, scored one and could have had another.\n8.\nSubstitutes: walcott (for sturridge, 57 minutes): odd flash of pace and one rising shot over the bar but otherwise quiet.\n6.\nClyne (for rose, 57 minutes): not much of an opportunity and consequently not much impact.\n5.\nKane (for lallana, 70 minutes): just a couple of half-chances but no rescue act from the man who is now england's first-choice striker.\n5.\nJagielka (for smalling, 70 minutes): claimed he was fouled by janssen in the lead-up to the winner but should have been stronger in that situation.\n5.\nAlli (for milner, 82 minutes): no rating.\nDier (for drinkwater, 84 minutes): no rating.\nThe three lions wait until 21 may to host turkey, while netherlands meet republic of ireland six days later.\nMatch ends, england 1, netherlands 2.\nSecond half ends, england 1, netherlands 2.\nFoul by dele alli (england).\nIbrahim afellay (netherlands) wins a free kick in the defensive half.\nSubstitution, netherlands.\nJordy clasie replaces vincent

tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit [patient] okay that's painful [doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that [patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time [doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year [patient] okay okay [doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour [patient] okay [doctor] okay [patient] alright sounds good [doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection [patient] alright thank you [doctor] alright thank you [patient] bye", "summary": "Larry, a patient, consulted a doctor about his chronic lower back pain that started after moving furniture.

right shoulder pain that you've had for a few weeks now [patient] yeah it was i was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know i was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just has n't been going away [doctor] okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before [patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so [doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not [patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it [doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go [patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain [doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also [patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so [doctor] okay [patient] of course [doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that [patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it [doctor] okay and does that seem to help or [patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit [doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and [patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift [doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then [patient] yeah [doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or [patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of [doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven .\nEight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan [patient] no that sounds good [doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay [patient] sounds great [doctor] okay thanks [patient] thanks [doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or [patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but [doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that [patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good", "summary": "The patient is experiencing shoulder pain that

about if you if i push down on both your feet like this can you push back up on my hands [patient] can you repeat that [doctor] if i'm pushing down on your feet can you push push your feet back [patient] i [doctor] alright so your dorsiflexion is normal looks like pulses are equal in all extremities you said you had a little bit of a tingling sensation in which leg [patient] that would be my right leg [doctor] okay so some tingling in your right leg alright so i know that you had an x-ray when you came in because we always do x-rays when we have our patients come in of your low back and everything looks normal from that perspective so for your back pain sounds like you probably sprained your low back so i what i want you to do is let's rest it i'm going to prescribe some meloxicam have you taken that before [patient] i have not taken meloxicam [doctor] alright so i'll prescribe that i'm also gon na prescribe some physical therapy i know you said you have n't been overly active and your partner reported the same thing for a long time so we might wan na get you into some pt and hopefully get you back back in shape get you some stretches that you can do and some exercises and then you know if it's not improving i want you to send me a message and we can possibly look into see if there is anything else going on potentially an mri if it's still not improving does that sound like an okay plan [patient] it sounds reasonable [doctor] alright [patient] i think he should have an mri now i think he had surgery yesterday i think he should have an mri now this it's been hurting for like six hours now and she had an mri we are really worried about it [doctor] alright you know let's give it a couple of weeks and let's give it two weeks and then call me back and we'll get you an mri if it's still not improving [patient] good answer [doctor] alright alright hope you feel better", "summary": "A patient visited a doctor for back pain that started after raking leaves.

yeah i was getting ready for the holiday weekend and i was out on my boat skiing and i i did a jump and kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since [doctor] okay so that was about five days ago then [patient] yeah yeah that was last weekend [doctor] last weekend okay now which knee is it [patient] it's my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened [patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards [doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance [patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore [doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before [patient] no that was the first time [doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake [patient] lake martin [doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier [patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can [doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day [patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway [doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked [patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days [doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing [patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it [doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all [patient] no just the swelling and the pain [doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain [patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day [doctor] okay and [patient] putting a cold pack on it [doctor] okay and has that helped at all [patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though [doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here [patient] i had my tonsils out [doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press [patient] yeah that's sore [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt [patient] yeah do n't do that anymore [doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that [patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan [doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions [patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me

an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and

on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches [patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach [doctor] great [patient] starting in april so [doctor] alright well [patient] how long [doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again [patient] okay [doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly [patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out [doctor] yeah i i'm a dog walker as well so alright sorry for the bad news but let's get you healed up so that we can get

left or some right shoulder pain that you've had for a few weeks now [patient] yeah it was i was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know i was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just has n't been going away [doctor] okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before [patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so [doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not [patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it [doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go [patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain [doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also [patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so [doctor] okay [patient] of course [doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that [patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it [doctor] okay and does that seem to help or [patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit [doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and [patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift [doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then [patient] yeah [doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or [patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of [doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven .\nEight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan [patient] no that sounds good [doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay [patient] sounds great [doctor] okay thanks [patient] thanks [doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or [patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but [doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that [patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good", "summary": "The patient, Bobby, visited

have a lotta pain here and here .\nBut i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not .\nIt gets painful and builds up .\nSo i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk

n't really wear a regular bra that often .\nI mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable .\nAnd the others are expensive in my size .\n[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well .\nAnd , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?\n[patient] no , i do not have any kids now .\nBut we might plan to in the future .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?\n[patient] sometimes , yes .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ?\nAnd , and it could be from sweating .\n[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?\n[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running .\nAnd it hurts .\n[doctor] and it hurts , okay .\nAnd , and you saw a chiropractor .\nBut what about physical therapy for your back pain ?\nOr do you take any pain medicine for it ?\n[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .\n[doctor] that's okay .\nSo let's see .\nI know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family .\nHave you had any mammograms ?\nAnd how old was your mother when she had it ?\n[patient] mom was 40 .\nAnd they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram .\nI'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 .\nSo i'm still a little bit young .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?\n[patient] yes , for the most part .\nI

powerful rising drive.\nThe debate about how best to use vardy may go on but one thing is beyond dispute - he is going to euro 2016 and has the ability to threaten every defence in france.\nIn an ideal world, everton's john stones would have come in at wembley to produce the sort of elegant display that became his trademark in the early seasons of his career, thus cementing his place alongside chris smalling for england's first euro 2016 game against russia in marseille.\nInstead, wembley witnessed a 21-year-old whose confidence has been hit by a recent dip in form at club level and will need a little renovating before the serious action gets under way.\nStones twice brought murmurs of concern from england's fans inside wembley with his tendency to perhaps over-play out of defence, but his determination to be constructive also started the passing move that led to vardy's goal.\nThe young defender is a work in progress and there will be slips - quite literally when he stumbled at the start of a chain of events that led to england keeper fraser forster having to save well from janssen before rose handled to leave the striker to score from the spot.\nStones is well worth persevering with - but hodgson must hope some of that confidence and composure returns quickly.\nHodgson warned they must not get carried away after victory in germany - and, in case anyone ignored the warning, along comes a defeat against a dutch team that will not even be in france this summer.\nIn some respects this defeat, albeit with a much-changed side, simply reinforced some of the lessons that came out of the win in germany that was the catalyst for such a surge of optimism.\nEngland have some very exciting options up front in the shape of vardy and harry kane, while daniel sturridge also got a decent 57 minutes under his belt.\nQuestions remain, however, about a frail-looking defence with both full-back spots still up for grabs and no central-defensive pairing jumping out as hodgson's first choice at this stage.\nEngland certainly carry a threat but fears persist about their ability to resist attacks of the highest calibre.\nFraser forster: solid night for the southampton keeper despite a couple of fumbles.\nSaved well from georginio wijnaldum and vincent janssen.\nClear deputy to joe hart.\n7.\nKyle walker: solid and quick in defence and a threat in attack with a perfect pass for vardy to score england's goal.\n7.\nChris smalling: part of an uncertain central-defensive partnership that once again hinted at england's frailty against attacks possessing real quality.\n6.\nJohn stones: not a great night for everton's 21-year-old.\nYes, his determination to play started the move for england's goal but too often caused anxiety with his tendency to overdo things and second-half slip started chain of events that led to the dutch equaliser.\n5.\nDanny rose: not an easy night for england's defence but rose kept going and may consider himself unlucky to be punished for the handball that led to a penalty.\n6.\nJames milner: anonymous as england's captain.\nMilner is a solid presence but not big on inspirational moments.\n5.\nDanny drinkwater: solid debut from the leicester city midfielder.\nDid himself no harm and can be happy with his debut but did he make a compelling case for inclusion in euro 2016?\nNot sure.\n6.\nRoss barkley: busy first half and a trademark second-half surge that set up a chance for adam lallana.\n6.\nAdam lallana: decent night for the liverpool midfielder.\nClever pass played its part in england's goal and was warmly applauded when substituted.\n7.\nDaniel sturridge: once he'd stopped fiddling with his bootlaces he settled down and produced one or two moments that hint at the threat he could yet pose for england.\n6.\nJamie vardy: england's star man.\nBusy, scored one and could have had another.\n8.\nSubstitutes: walcott (for sturridge, 57 minutes): odd flash of pace and one rising shot over the bar but otherwise quiet.\n6.\nClyne (for rose, 57 minutes): not much of an opportunity and consequently not much impact.\n5.\nKane (for lallana, 70 minutes): just a couple of half-chances but no rescue act from the man who is now england's first-choice striker.\n5.\nJagielka (for smalling, 70 minutes): claimed he was fouled by janssen in the lead-up to the winner but should have been stronger in that situation.\n5.\nAlli (for milner, 82 minutes): no rating.\nDier (for drinkwater, 84 minutes): no rating.\nThe three lions wait until 21 may to host turkey, while

might - be inclined to buy into it.\nIs he even thinking about it that way?\nYou would hope so, but it's unlikely.\nThere is so much to ponder.\nDoes scotland have to follow a slavish adherence to 4-2-3-1?\nCan a solution be found to the absence of dominant centre-backs by converting a full-back or a midfielder?\nMaybe not, but where are the ideas?\nWe saw a snapshot of strachan's out-of-the-box thinking when he played ikechi anya at right-back at wembley.\nWhat happens when kieran tierney and andrew robertson are both fit at left-back, along with lee wallace and stephen kingsley?\nIs it really one from four there?\nDoes it have to be that way?\nWhere's the innovation, the sense of a manager trying something a bit different?\nAnd what about an enhanced cast of characters on the scene?\nAberdeen's graeme shinnie, fulham's tom cairney, brighton's jamie murphy, aston villa's ross mccormack, stoke city's phil bardsley and, yes, if he ever starts playing and scoring again, middlesbrough's jordan rhodes.\nThere are others, either on the periphery of the squad or totally divorced from it, that could be looked at properly.\nToo often, strachan has been rigid in his thinking and it's done nothing for the team.\nThe tired mantra that \"the players are just not there\" is an entirely bogus argument when all that is being asked is that scotland become truly competitive, like northern ireland.\nThey have decent premier league centre-halves - from west brom, who sit 11th - and an impressive midfielder from southampton - who are 10th - but who have precious little else in terms of quality and, most especially, depth.\nAnd yet, from a squad largely made up of championship, league one and scottish premiership players, northern ireland get the kind of results that are beyond scotland.\nThe attitude of \"no manager could do better with these players\" is fatalism.\nIt's tantamount to a white flag being raised.\nA quitter's charter, the central tenet of which is blown to the high heavens by what michael o'neill is doing with his meagre resources in belfast.\nThe sfa's statement on thursday did nothing to challenge the view that a blind faith - or a meek acceptance of failure -  has taken an ever firmer hold of hampden.\nWhen they can't get a draw against georgia, can't beat lithuania and can't avoid a drubbing against a moderate team like slovakia, the idea of scotland suddenly morphing into a points machine is a hard sell.\nScotland took the most affordable option, but a dwindling number of supporters would agree that it was the best one.", "summary": "The Scottish Football Association (SFA) has failed to mention the financial savings involved with outing national team manager Gordon Strachan in its statement, released on 10 November 2016.

\u00a32.5bn) to improve life in a number of african countries.\nThis in addition to the \u20ac20bn it already gives in aid to africa.\nSomalia's distinctly unimpressed prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke put it to the bbc that africa needed investment, not charity, to improve its economies.\nThe same as the us, the eu or anywhere else in the world, he said.\nIn fact, eu countries couldn't even muster the pledged extra cash.\nIt's a promise they seem unable or unwilling to keep.\nThe european commission says it will put in \u20ac1.8bn and wants the rest of the new fund made up by individual european nations.\nSo far they've coughed up less than \u20ac80m.\nThe eu was also unable to persuade/charm - some say bully - african countries into automatically receiving deported migrants back.\nInstead, in the written summit conclusions, the eu was forced to emphasise \"voluntary repatriations\".\nThat prompted obvious questions about the bloc's declared aim of \"speeding up the return\" of economic migrants and other failed asylum seekers - a key part of its plan to tackle the migrant crisis.\nIn short: the summit was not a resounding success.\nAnd a number of european newspapers were critical of the eu even trying to make a deal.\nGermany's sueddeutsche zeitung says the eu's offer of money to reduce the refugee numbers from africa could open the eu to accusations of \"showing its real values by co-operating with unjust regimes\".\nSimilar objections are raised when it comes to eu attempts to strike a deal with turkey - now the main departure point for refugees and other migrants crossing to europe.\nEu leaders are planning a turkey summit before the end of the year, but - as german chancellor angela merkel has pointed out - \"ankara holds the cards\".\nAnd diplomats worry that ankara will demand an extravagant bouquet in terms of money and political concessions - such as lifting visa restrictions, and accelerating turkey's eu membership bid - in exchange for help on migration.\nAnd again, critics challenge the eu for courting turkey at all - a country with an imperious president and dismal human rights record.\nThere are also those who say the eu's focus is far too fixed on creating \"fortress europe\", on keeping people out and not on introducing legal ways for them to come to over.\nBecause come they will.\nThe european commission expects about three million refugees and other migrants to arrive in europe by 2017.\nClearly, whatever the eu does during this crisis, it will come under fire from some quarter or another.\nAll too often, it comes up against itself - a behemoth of 28 nations, struggling to work together.\nEven the quota system - accepted (reluctantly) by most eu countries - to share out more equally the asylum seekers in europe is an unmitigated flop so far.\nAgreed number of people to be relocated: 160,000.\nPeople moved to date: 147.\nCross-border co-operation is disintegrating as barbed wire goes up and borders slam shut across europe: in slovenia, hungary, austria, sweden, norway\u2026 even germany is toughening border regulations.\nIn stark contrast to the warm welcome given to hundreds or thousands earlier this autumn, wolfgang schaeuble, germany's hugely popular finance minister, has begun to mutter darkly about a migrant \"avalanche\" engulfing his country.\nThere's little evidence of the eu - more of each country for itself.\nThat prompted the president of the european council, donald tusk, to warn that schengen, the eu agreement allowing passport-free travel across much of europe, risks collapse.\nYet it is one of the eu's proudest achievements.\nYou could argue schengen has already wilted and died.", "summary": "The EU has a lot to offer migrants and refugees in need of a safe passage to Europe: and its political will to help them is not in doubt, as it battles over how to cope with the huge numbers arriving.

and the even smaller decline in the proportion of top a* and a grades - is that there is \"stability\".\nThis isn't an accident.\nThe annual exam results are not like going outside and measuring the temperature as a natural phenomenon which might fluctuate.\nIt's more like setting the central heating to an agreed level and then holding up a thermometer to see if the temperature is where it should be.\nWell, perhaps that's not a complete analogy, but the national exam statistics, with their neat similarity to last year, are a work of design rather than nature.\nThe huge annual challenge for the exam system is to balance a number of competing demands.\nThere has to be room for some slight ups and downs, but there mustn't be grade inflation, standards have to be maintained over time and - at the very heart of the process - it has to be a fair reward for the hard work of individual pupils.\nAdd to this complex equation the need to adjust grades between different exam boards.\nHead teachers' leader brian lightman has complained that below the smooth surface of the national statistics, there can be doubts about the reliability of individual results.\nHe has warned of \"volatility\", with heads unable to explain sudden dips and spikes, problems that remain unnoticed from a national perspective.\n\"it is devastating for a student who has been on course for a certain grade to miss what they were expected to achieve and it is mystifying to their teachers,\" said mr lightman.\nThe lingering question is if one year's results are reverse engineered to be very similar to the year before, does this mean distorting some of the results to make sure that they fit?\nAre there winners and losers in some subjects and at some grades?\nOfqual has always argued that fairness for individual students is not compromised by the demands of the wider results system.\nBut it's a massively complicated challenge for exam boards and regulator - made even more difficult by the conflicting legacies of previous grading systems.\nOnce there was a system of fixed quotas which prevented any rise in grades and then a system which allowed grades to rise every single year.\nNow there is a system which holds out the possibility of change, but which manages to keep things the same.\nAnother factor that gets overlooked in the headlines, is that the results can be changed by who is taking the exam.\nThis year's nudge upwards in the pass rate has come alongside an older cohort.\nThere are fewer 14 and 15 year olds taking the gcses early, because the league tables now only recognise the first attempt.\nAnd another change in government policy means that pupils who missed out on gcse maths and english last year are having to re-sit the exam this year.\nThis means that more than 300,000 exam entries were from 17 year olds.\nBut if the changes at the overall level are measured in fractions of a percentage point, there are some very striking differences between england, northern ireland and wales.\nNorthern ireland's pupils are stretching their lead over everyone else, jumping by 0.7% to 78.7%.\nIt raises the question how such results can be achieved when only 66% make the grade in wales.\nNot only is the northern ireland figure far ahead of england, it is ahead of the highest-achieving part of england, which was london with 72%.\nEngland's education system has been in a state of almost constant reform since the late 1980s, but the latest results show it is northern ireland that is stretching further ahead.\nWhen these regional differences are overlaid with the gender gap, it means that young women in northern ireland are doing much better than anyone else.\nThe scores from the gcse top grades show the gap.\nAmong entries from female pupils in northern ireland, 11.4% achieve a* grades.\nAmong male pupils in wales, the figure is 4.5%.\nIn england, 5.2% of entries from male pupils and 7.9% of female achieve these highest a* grades.\nThis sets a pattern for a-levels and university entry, with northern irish women the most likely in the uk to get university places.\nWhether or not it is going to be consolation for england's school leaders, such comparisons are soon going to be impossible.\nBecause in a couple of years england's gcses will begin to be graded from 9 to 1 rather than a to g, ending a common system with wales and northern ireland.\nAnother curious aside is that many of the pupils taking gcses this year in england did not take their sats tests five years ago, because of a primary school teachers' boycott.\nWhat difference did it make in the long term?\nIt would take another exam to answer that one.", "summary": "GCSE exam results for over five million students in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales have been released.

One concern raised by educators is the reliability of individual results, as sudden changes or inconsistencies may not be apparent from a national perspective.

with you there now hepatitis c is a viral infection that affects the liver so you most likely may have had it for years now so the next step that i would like to do is to confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work that includes checking the hep c rna and also the hcv genotype okay now i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the

kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since [doctor] okay so that was about five days ago then [patient] yeah yeah that was last weekend [doctor] last weekend okay now which knee is it [patient] it's my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened [patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards [doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance [patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore [doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before [patient] no that was the first time [doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake [patient] lake martin [doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier [patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can [doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day [patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway [doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked [patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days [doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing [patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it [doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all [patient] no just the swelling and the pain [doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain [patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day [doctor] okay and [patient] putting a cold pack on it [doctor] okay and has that helped at all [patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though [doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here [patient] i had my tonsils out [doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press [patient] yeah that's sore [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt [patient] yeah do n't do that anymore [doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that [patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan [doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions [patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me [doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye [patient]

the engine cool off for an accurate reading.\nThinking that i just finished my first successful oil change, i drive to my apartment and head in for the night.\nThe next morning i woke up and got ready for work.\nI opened up the hood of my truck and checked the dipstick.\nThe oil still showed high, several inches above the \"too much\" notch.\nI replaced the dipstick and closed my hood.\nI decided i should probably go to my parent's house and let out some more oil before i go to work, shouldn't be a few minutes for a quart or two, right?\nI pull out of my parking space, noticing that reverse took a few seconds to catch before lurching backwards.\nI put it in drive and once again i drift in neutral before the gear catches, jumping the truck forward and moving along.\nI turn out of the gate and onto the main road when i think some rpm's would maybe fix the problem.\nI push the gas and my engine revs up to 5,000 rpm  for a moment before catching first gear.\nI drive for about a quarter of a mile at 15 mph before it solidifies that something very serious is wrong with my beloved truck.\nI pull off onto a residential street, barely making a protected left turn at my speed.\nOnce parked, i call my step dad and explain the situation.\nHe agrees it sounds strange and thinks maybe there is not enough engine oil in the engine.\nHe drives to me with some of the materials, but after a few minutes we realize we had better let the professionals deal with it.\nI call up our local shop and explain the situation.\nHis tone is ice cold, \"do not turn your engine back on.\nYou drained all of your transmission fluid.\nI'm surprised you got as far as you did (6 miles total.)\nThere could be possible internal damage in your engine from pushing double the oil through it causing dangerously high pressure.\nTow your truck here and we'll handle the rest.\"\n$4,000 and a new transmission later, here i am making this post.\nLuckily the engine wasn't damaged.\n**edit:** i understand i made a mistake by not doing my own research, but is it really that hard to believe i would trust my own step father to know what he was doing and follow his orders?\nObviously now i know not to trust him, even my mother told me not to trust him anymore after the whole incident.\nI don't need you people telling me i fucked up and that i shouldn't have listened to my step dad.\nThis fuck up and lesson

hey gregory good to see you today so take a look at my notes and i see that you're here you've had a nonhealing foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs

proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well

matthew i see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your pcp sent you over to see me how're you doing today [patient] pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse [doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there [patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time [doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version [patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden [doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at [patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month [doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes [patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here [doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me [patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg [doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life [patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten [doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better [patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down [doctor] okay [patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today [doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs [patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well [doctor] that's okay [patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day [doctor] absolutely [patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them [doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here [patient] no it's right here [doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there [patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks [doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please [patient] okay that's it that's all i got [doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan [patient] sure sounds good [doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na

next i'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and i want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area okay so i do n't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see you again in two weeks so we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay [patient] okay [doctor] okay so for your diabetes it's gon na be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal so we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without a being too much but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin a1c into a little bit better level okay [patient] okay [doctor] alright do you have any other questions [patient] no [doctor] okay", "summary": "The patient, Wayne, consulted the doctor for a sustained sore on his right foot that wasn't healing.

might - be inclined to buy into it.\nIs he even thinking about it that way?\nYou would hope so, but it's unlikely.\nThere is so much to ponder.\nDoes scotland have to follow a slavish adherence to 4-2-3-1?\nCan a solution be found to the absence of dominant centre-backs by converting a full-back or a midfielder?\nMaybe not, but where are the ideas?\nWe saw a snapshot of strachan's out-of-the-box thinking when he played ikechi anya at right-back at wembley.\nWhat happens when kieran tierney and andrew robertson are both fit at left-back, along with lee wallace and stephen kingsley?\nIs it really one from four there?\nDoes it have to be that way?\nWhere's the innovation, the sense of a manager trying something a bit different?\nAnd what about an enhanced cast of characters on the scene?\nAberdeen's graeme shinnie, fulham's tom cairney, brighton's jamie murphy, aston villa's ross mccormack, stoke city's phil bardsley and, yes, if he ever starts playing and scoring again, middlesbrough's jordan rhodes.\nThere are others, either on the periphery of the squad or totally divorced from it, that could be looked at properly.\nToo often, strachan has been rigid in his thinking and it's done nothing for the team.\nThe tired mantra that \"the players are just not there\" is an entirely bogus argument when all that is being asked is that scotland become truly competitive, like northern ireland.\nThey have decent premier league centre-halves - from west brom, who sit 11th - and an impressive midfielder from southampton - who are 10th - but who have precious little else in terms of quality and, most especially, depth.\nAnd yet, from a squad largely made up of championship, league one and scottish premiership players, northern ireland get the kind of results that are beyond scotland.\nThe attitude of \"no manager could do better with these players\" is fatalism.\nIt's tantamount to a white flag being raised.\nA quitter's charter, the central tenet of which is blown to the high heavens by what michael o'neill is doing with his meagre resources in belfast.\nThe sfa's statement on thursday did nothing to challenge the view that a blind faith - or a meek acceptance of failure -  has taken an ever firmer hold of hampden.\nWhen they can't get a draw against georgia, can't beat lithuania and can't avoid a drubbing against a moderate team like slovakia, the idea of scotland suddenly morphing into a points machine is a hard sell.\nScotland took the most affordable option, but a dwindling number of supporters would agree that it was the best one.", "summary": "The SFA's statement contained more than a hint of damage limitation -

until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control

or else the actors themselves carry candles.\nLight and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era.\n\"darkness was a terrifying presence,\" says dr karim-cooper.\n\"darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick.\nIt was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.\"\nShe says that if elizabethans or jacobeans travelled in time to modern london \"their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light\".\nAnother big difference is that shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.\nThe modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.\nIn the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen.\nThe really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.\nAnd one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.\n\"it was a very social occasion,\" says dr karim-cooper, describing the shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.\n\"contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,\" she says.\nPutting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.\nFor instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says dr karim-cooper.\nModern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue.\nWhen the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.\nThere are other big changes between a modern and shakespearean theatre visit.\nIt would have smelled very different, says dr karim-cooper.\nThere would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.\nAnother sensory difference would have been the \"soundscape\", she says.\nIt would have been a much softer sound, as elizabethan london didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.\n\"in terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,\" she says.\n\"there are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming.\nThey never heard a plane taking off.\"\nThe language would have sounded unusual too.\nThe accent of the time would have meant words such as \"move\" and \"love\" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.\nAnd the globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.\nThe role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.\n\"there is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do.\nIt wouldn't work,\" says dr karim-cooper.\nInstead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions.\nThey pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.\n\"we want to get beyond wikipedia,\" she says.\nShe is co-editor of moving shakespeare indoors, a collection of essays on indoor jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the globe's work.\nThere is a postgraduate degree course in shakespeare studies with king's college, london.\nThere are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers.\nEvery year there is a landmark schools production, the playing shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for london pupils.\nIt's been a huge success, with many  coming to see shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before.\nDr karim-cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory.\n\"we want to become a research hub.\nWe want students to be here.\"\nThe \"unique blend\" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the \"literary rigour\".\n\"we don't separate the practical from the academic.\"", "summary": "Shakespeare's Globe on London's Bankside has an in-house team of scholars, researchers, and academic advisers who work to inform the design and performances of the theatre.

did you just kind of cut catch yourself [patient] no i fell [doctor] okay and were you able to get up afterwards or somebody helped you up [patient] i was but it was very sore and then started swelling and quite a bit of pain so it's hard to walk [doctor] sure have you tried anything for pain or the swelling or anything like that [patient] ibuprofen some ice and elevation [doctor] okay has that helped much or not really [patient] a little bit [doctor] okay and any pain above your ankle does it hurt on your on your calf or your lower leg at all or knee at all [patient] no it's mostly

in a second we'll examine you in a second but since you're here and i wanted to talk about some of your other things that you know we have n't i have n't seen you in a year so let's talk about your history of diabetes as well are you taking the metformin how's your blood sugars been how how're you managing that any issues with that [patient] no they've been pretty stable [doctor] okay [patient] so with my diet [doctor] good [patient] so [doctor] you're checking your sugars regularly as well [patient] yes [doctor] okay your hemoglobin a1c last time i looked at epic was about six .\nEight which is really good so i think you're doing a great job we had talked about you know cutting off the sweets and sugars and stuff like that and exercising so it sounds like you're you're you're doing a pretty good job with that have you seen the ophthalmologist recently for your eye exam for your diabetes checkup or no [patient] i am due for one of those in the next couple of weeks [doctor] okay alright so we'll so you do you already have an appointment or do you need to make an appointment for that [patient] i have an appointment [doctor] perfect excellent okay and how is your blood pressure been i know we watching it your blood pressure today looks pretty good it's about one seventy over i'm sorry one twenty over seventy you're taking norvasc any issues with that any do you need any refills or anything [patient] i need a refill on that yes [doctor] okay alright well let me examine you here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my match exam and i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put that into my record okay so your neck exam is fine there is no bruits your lungs are clear your heart exam is normal you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is i think you probably have an ankle sprain but i would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone and i'm sometimes worried about a fracture so i'm gon na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you [patient] that's a great plan i need to get back to exercising so [doctor] okay [patient] thank you [doctor] perfect and for the diabetes keep the eye appointment that you already have you know continue with the metformin i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check some baseline labs

you had some knee pain yeah i was getting ready for the holiday weekend and i was out on my boat skiing and i i did a jump and kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since [doctor] okay so that was about five days ago then [patient] yeah yeah that was last weekend [doctor] last weekend okay now which knee is it [patient] it's my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened [patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards [doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance [patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore [doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before [patient] no that was the first time [doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake [patient] lake martin [doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier [patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can [doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day [patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway [doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked [patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days [doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing [patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it [doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all [patient] no just the swelling and the pain [doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain [patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day [doctor] okay and [patient] putting a cold pack on it [doctor] okay and has that helped at all [patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though [doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here [patient] i had my tonsils out [doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press [patient] yeah that's sore [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt [patient] yeah do n't do that anymore [doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that [patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan [doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions [patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me [doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye [patient] thank you", "summary": "The document discusses a patient who

labs are consistent with hepatitis c so based on the the once i just discussed with you there now hepatitis c is a viral infection that affects the liver so you most likely may have had it for years

determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and i'm gon na do this by ordering a special ultrasound and with this information i'm gon na be able to know how to

like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse [doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there [patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time [doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version [patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden [doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at [patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month [doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes [patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here [doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me [patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg [doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life [patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten [doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better [patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down [doctor] okay [patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today [doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs [patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well [doctor] that's okay [patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day [doctor] absolutely [patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them [doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here [patient] no it's right here [doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there [patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks [doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please [patient] okay that's it that's all i got [doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan [patient] sure sounds good [doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na

for a couple of weeks and it's not getting better i saw my pcp and they referred me to you i i used to see a podiatrist and a couple of years ago but they moved and i was n't able to get another one [doctor] okay and how long have you had the wound [patient] about two to three weeks [doctor] okay have you had any kind of trauma to that foot [patient] no i bought a new pair of shoes to travel with and the neuropathy i guess i did n't feel that they were too tight at first it was just a blister but it looked a lot worse now i've been putting a band-aid on it and [doctor] okay and so did your doctor put you on any antibiotics when they they saw your foot [patient] yes i finished the course yesterday the wound looked about the same though [doctor] okay now does it hurt [patient] no i ca n't feel it [doctor] okay now have you had any other symptoms like fever chills drainage from the wound or anything along those lines [patient] no but when i take my sock off sometimes it sticks to the

diabetes doing [patient] i do n't think it's too bad my last hgb a1c was a little over eight [doctor] okay alright well let me just do a quick physical exam okay for vital signs your temperature is ninety eight .\nOne your vital signs look good your heart rate is seventy two respirations sixteen blood pressure is one ten over sixty five okay so on your foot exam let's see there is a one by two

there's no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there's no evidence of fluid collection there's no necrosis there is no odor i do not appreciate any bony exposure on on vascular exam there are

that's really good so let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem your diabetic foot ulcer so i want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to your foot to see if you can heal this wound i'm also gon na perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue and then next i'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and i want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area okay so i do n't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see you again in two weeks so we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay [patient] okay [doctor] okay so for your diabetes it's gon na be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal so we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without a being too much but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin a1c into a little bit better level okay [patient] okay [doctor] alright do you have any other questions [patient] no [doctor] okay", "summary":

china's dji - has already decided to limit initial sales of its phantom 3 flagship to a design that features its own proprietary video camera.\nThe previous generation had been launched instead with an optional mount for gopro cams.\nMr woodman said he planned to release the gopro drone within the first half of 2016, and that it would be targeted at consumers.\n\"quadcopters have a special place for us at gopro because i was a huge radio-controlled plane enthusiast as a kid and i could never really get anyone involved in it with me because it was either too geeky or it took a lot of time to learn how to fly these things - you'd crash them all the time,\" he said.\n\"so, i was really surprised to see how quickly the general consumer was adopting quadcopters.\n\"quads plus gopro has been one of the most democratising combinations in terms of enabling people to capture professional quality content and see themselves in their environment in a way that they'd never seen before.\nIt looks like you're in your own movie.\"\nDrones are expected to be one of the fastest growing electronics sectors over the coming years.\nAccording to the us's consumer electronics association, the global market for consumer drones totalled $84m (\u00e2\u00a354m) last year but is forecast to top $300m by 2018.\nThe cea adds that if regulators relax the rules for the use of such aircraft by commercial organisations, the market could further swell to $1bn by 2020.\nThat could represent a lucrative new market for gopro.\nThe firm's existing cameras and other accessories generated $363m of sales over the first three months of 2015.\nThat was up 54% on the previous year, but resulted in a relatively slim net profit of $16.8m.\nMr woodman also showed off a prototype mount that can hold six of his firm's hero4 cameras, each pointing in a different direction.\nHe said the resulting footage could be stitched together using software developed by kolor - a start-up it bought last month - to create a single 6k-quality 360-degree image.\nThis could then be used with virtual reality helmets - allowing a user to change their perspective by turning their head left and right and looking up and down - or via youtube and facebook, which are both adding support for interactive spherical videos.\nThe six-camera spherical array add-on will go on sale later this year.\nMr woodman acknowledged, however, that the high cost of buying enough cameras to fill it was likely to limit the mount's appeal to professionals.\nAt a subsequent event, google also announced a more elaborate virtual reality capture device, which involves 16 gopro cameras, as part of a tie-up between the two companies.\nThe footage produced by the jump camera array will be processed by the search firm's own software to produce panoramas, rather than spherical videos, that make use of depth data deduced by google's algorithms.", "summary": "GoPro's CEO has announced plans for the company to produce its own quadcopter drones with the intention of targeting the consumer market.

might - be inclined to buy into it.\nIs he even thinking about it that way?\nYou would hope so, but it's unlikely.\nThere is so much to ponder.\nDoes scotland have to follow a slavish adherence to 4-2-3-1?\nCan a solution be found to the absence of dominant centre-backs by converting a full-back or a midfielder?\nMaybe not, but where are the ideas?\nWe saw a snapshot of strachan's out-of-the-box thinking when he played ikechi anya at right-back at wembley.\nWhat happens when kieran tierney and andrew robertson are both fit at left-back, along with lee wallace and stephen kingsley?\nIs it really one from four there?\nDoes it have to be that way?\nWhere's the innovation, the sense of a manager trying something a bit different?\nAnd what about an enhanced cast of characters on the scene?\nAberdeen's graeme shinnie, fulham's tom cairney, brighton's jamie murphy, aston villa's ross mccormack, stoke city's phil bardsley and, yes, if he ever starts playing and scoring again, middlesbrough's jordan rhodes.\nThere are others, either on the periphery of the squad or totally divorced from it, that could be looked at properly.\nToo often, strachan has been rigid in his thinking and it's done nothing for the team.\nThe tired mantra that \"the players are just not there\" is an entirely bogus argument when all that is being asked is that scotland become truly competitive, like northern ireland.\nThey have decent premier league centre-halves - from west brom, who sit 11th - and an impressive midfielder from southampton - who are 10th - but who have precious little else in terms of quality and, most especially, depth.\nAnd yet, from a squad largely made up of championship, league one and scottish premiership players, northern ireland get the kind of results that are beyond scotland.\nThe attitude of \"no manager could do better with these players\" is fatalism.\nIt's tantamount to a white flag being raised.\nA quitter's charter, the central tenet of which is blown to the high heavens by what michael o'neill is doing with his meagre resources in belfast.\nThe sfa's statement on thursday did nothing to challenge the view that a blind faith - or a meek acceptance of failure -  has taken an ever firmer hold of hampden.\nWhen they can't get a draw against georgia, can't beat lithuania and can't avoid a drubbing against a moderate team like slovakia, the idea of scotland suddenly morphing into a points machine is a hard sell.\nScotland took the most affordable option, but a dwindling number of supporters would agree that it was the best one.", "summary": "The Scottish Football Association (SFA) recently released a statement regarding the future of national team manager Gordon Strachan, but the issue of monetary compensation for his potential departure was not addressed.

it's seven and a half milligrams every week and as long as i'm keeping active my joints feel okay and if i do have any problems it's it's mostly with my hands but i have n't had any recent flares so i'm okay right now [doctor] okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking [patient] i stopped smoking probably about seven years ago [doctor] okay [patient] and i was young and should have stopped the way before that my kids were on me all the time but you know i i got a new start and finally was able to stop and i felt better after stopping [doctor] okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that [patient] no not at all [doctor] okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies [patient] no lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer but she is doing well now [doctor] okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that [patient] no no not not anything that i'm aware of [doctor] okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process [patient] no i do n't think so i think i'll be okay i'm scared [doctor] i i know you're scared but we'll be right here with you the whole way [patient] okay [doctor] alright we'll get some paperwork and i'll see you again in a few minutes [patient] okay thank you", "summary": "Kyle, a patient with a previous history of bronchitis and

or else the actors themselves carry candles.\nLight and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era.\n\"darkness was a terrifying presence,\" says dr karim-cooper.\n\"darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick.\nIt was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.\"\nShe says that if elizabethans or jacobeans travelled in time to modern london \"their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light\".\nAnother big difference is that shakespeare''s audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.\nThe modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.\nIn the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen.\nThe really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.\nAnd one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed globe is that it''s impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.\n\"it was a very social occasion,\" says dr karim-cooper, describing the shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.\n\"contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,\" she says.\nPutting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.\nFor instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says dr karim-cooper.\nModern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue.\nWhen the audience and actors are looking into each other''s eyes, it becomes a different moment.\nThere are other big changes between a modern and shakespearean theatre visit.\nIt would have smelled very different, says dr karim-cooper.\nThere would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.\nAnother sensory difference would have been the \"soundscape\", she says.\nIt would have been a much softer sound, as elizabethan london didn''t have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.\n\"in terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,\" she says.\n\"there are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming.\nThey never heard a plane taking off.\"\nThe language would have sounded unusual too.\nThe accent of the time would have meant words such as \"move\" and \"love\" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.\nAnd the globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.\nThe role of the theatre''s research team isn''t to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.\n\"there is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do.\nIt wouldn''t work,\" says dr karim-cooper.\nInstead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions.\nThey pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.\n\"we want to get beyond wikipedia,\" she says.\nShe is co-editor of moving shakespeare indoors, a collection of essays on indoor jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the globe''s work.\nThere is a postgraduate degree course in shakespeare studies with king''s college, london.\nThere are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers.\nEvery year there is a landmark schools production, the playing shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for london pupils.\nIt''s been a huge success, with many  coming to see shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before.\nDr karim-cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory.\n\"we want to become a research hub.\nWe want students to be here.\"\nThe \"unique blend\" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the \"literary rigour\".\n\"we don''t separate the practical from the academic.\"", "summary": "The Globe Theatre in London has a unique approach to theatrical performances, combining academic rigor with practical experimentation.

getting ready for the next season that starts in in april and we were at the courts plan and i went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers i guess he could say and so he he found me while i was going for a lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen [doctor] yeah [patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym [doctor] okay [patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so [doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way [patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys [doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad [patient] yeah yes [doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too [patient] yeah a little bit [doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all [patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid [doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable [patient] yeah [doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches [patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach [doctor] great [patient] starting in april so [doctor] alright well [patient] how long [doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again [patient] okay [doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly [patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so

victory in germany as they were beaten in a friendly by the netherlands, who have not even qualified for euro 2016.\nOn a night when wembley paid its respects to the late dutch legend johan cruyff with applause in the 14th minute, a much-changed england side slipped to a rare defeat at the national stadium.\nMan-of-the-match jamie vardy rounded off a slick passing move to steer in kyle walker's cross four minutes before the interval - but roy hodgson's side could not protect their lead.\nEngland's defence lived on the edge too often and were eventually punished when a sloppy passage of play led to danny rose handling, and vincent janssen scored from the spot after 50 minutes.\nThe big striker was then too strong for substitute phil jagielka, although england complained bitterly he had been fouled, before crossing for luciano narsingh to score the winner 13 minutes from  time.\nVardy's transition from the heights he has scaled with leicester city this season to england has been seamless - and he has stepped up a level in the two friendlies against germany and the netherlands.\nThe 29-year-old has been portrayed as both an ideal starter and the perfect impact substitute as hodgson makes plans for euro 2016.\nVardy has proved his capabilities for both, with an explosive 20-minute cameo in berlin that included a brilliantly instinctive finish as part of england's comeback.\nAnd here, he was england's outstanding performer by some distance, showing the pace and energy that has panicked premier league defences and also skill to round off that passing move with a clinical finish before testing dutch keeper jeroen zoet with a powerful rising drive.\nThe debate about how best to use vardy may go on but one thing is beyond dispute - he is going to euro 2016 and has the ability to threaten every defence in france.\nIn an ideal world, everton's john stones would have come in at wembley to produce the sort of elegant display that became his trademark in the early seasons of his career, thus cementing his place alongside chris smalling for england's first euro 2016 game against russia in marseille.\nInstead, wembley witnessed a 21-year-old whose confidence has been hit by a recent dip in form at club level and will need a little renovating before the serious action gets under way.\nStones twice brought murmurs of concern from england's fans inside wembley with his tendency to perhaps over-play out of defence, but his determination to be constructive also started the passing move that led to vardy's goal.\nThe young defender is a work in progress and there will be slips - quite literally when he stumbled at the start of a chain of events that led to england keeper fraser forster having to save well from janssen before rose handled to leave the striker to score from the spot.\nStones is well worth persevering with - but hodgson must hope some of that confidence and composure returns quickly.\nHodgson warned they must not get carried away after victory in germany - and, in case anyone ignored the warning, along comes a defeat against a dutch team that will not even be in france this summer.\nIn some respects this defeat, albeit with a much-changed side, simply reinforced some of the lessons that came out of the win in germany that was the catalyst for such a surge of optimism.\nEngland have some very exciting options up front in the shape of vardy and harry kane, while daniel sturridge also got a decent 57 minutes under his belt.\nQuestions remain, however, about a frail-looking defence with both full-back spots still up for grabs and no central-defensive pairing jumping out as hodgson's first choice at this stage.\nEngland certainly carry a threat but fears persist about their ability to resist attacks of the highest calibre.\nFraser forster: solid night for the southampton keeper despite a couple of fumbles.\nSaved well from georginio wijnaldum and vincent janssen.\nClear deputy to joe hart.\n7.\nKyle walker: solid and quick in defence and a threat in attack with a perfect pass for vardy to score england's goal.\n7.\nChris smalling: part of an uncertain central-defensive partnership that once again hinted at england's frailty against attacks possessing real quality.\n6.\nJohn stones: not a great night for everton's 21-year-old.\nYes, his determination to play started the move for england's goal but too often caused anxiety with his tendency to overdo things and second-half slip started chain of events that led to the dutch equaliser.\n5.\nDanny rose: not an easy night for england's defence but rose kept going and may consider himself unlucky to be punished for the handball that led to a penalty.\n6.\nJames milner: anonymous as england's captain.\nMilner is a solid presence but not big on inspirational moments.\n5.\nDanny drinkwater: solid debut from the leicester city midfielder.\nDid himself no harm and can be happy with his debut but did he make a compelling case for inclusion in euro 2016?\nNot sure.\n6.\nRoss barkley: busy first half and a trademark second-half surge that set up a chance for adam lallana.\n6.\nAdam lallana: decent night for the liverpool midfielder.\nClever pass played its part in england's goal and was warmly applauded when substituted.\n7.\nDaniel sturridge: once he'd stopped fiddling with his bootlaces he settled down and produced one or two moments that hint at the threat he could yet pose for england.\n6.\nJamie vardy: england's star man.\nBusy, scored one and could have had another.\n8.\nSubstitutes: walcott (for sturridge, 57 minutes): odd flash of pace and one rising shot over the bar but otherwise quiet.\n6.\nClyne (for rose, 57 minutes): not much of an opportunity and consequently not much impact.\n5.\nKane (for lallana, 70 minutes): just a couple of half-chances but no rescue act from the man who is now england's first-choice striker.\n5.\nJagielka (for smalling, 70 minutes): claimed he was fouled by janssen in the lead-up to the winner but should have been stronger in that situation.\n5.\nAlli (for milner, 82 minutes): no rating.\nDier (for drinkwater, 84 minutes): no rating.\nThe three lions wait until 21 may to host turkey,

which will be five million different stories of exam dreams, dramas and disasters.\nBut the overall national picture for gcse grades is very similar to last year.\nThe proportion getting a* to c grades has nudged up from 68.8% to 69%.\nThat represents an improvement for more than 10,000 exam entries.\nBut the overall message - and the even smaller decline in the proportion of top a* and a grades - is that there is \"stability\".\nThis isn't an accident.\nThe annual exam results are not like going outside and measuring the temperature as a natural phenomenon which might fluctuate.\nIt's more like setting the central heating to an agreed level and then holding up a thermometer to see if the temperature is where it should be.\nWell, perhaps that's not a complete analogy, but the national exam statistics, with their neat similarity to last year, are a work of design rather than nature.\nThe huge annual challenge for the exam system is to balance a number of competing demands.\nThere has to be room for some slight ups and downs, but there mustn't be grade inflation, standards have to be maintained over time and - at the very heart of the process - it has to be a fair reward for the hard work of individual pupils.\nAdd to this complex equation the need to adjust grades between different exam boards.\nHead teachers' leader brian lightman has complained that below the smooth surface of the national statistics, there can be doubts about the reliability of individual results.\nHe has warned of \"volatility\", with heads unable to explain sudden dips and spikes, problems that remain unnoticed from a national perspective.\n\"it is devastating for a student who has been on course for a certain grade to miss what they were expected to achieve and it is mystifying to their teachers,\" said mr lightman.\nThe lingering question is if one year's results are reverse engineered to be very similar to the year before, does this mean distorting some of the results to make sure that they fit?\nAre there winners and losers in some subjects and at some grades?\nOfqual has always argued that fairness for individual students is not compromised by the demands of the wider results system.\nBut it's a massively complicated challenge for exam boards and regulator - made even more difficult by the conflicting legacies of previous grading systems.\nOnce there was a system of fixed quotas which prevented any rise in grades and then a system which allowed grades to rise every single year.\nNow there is a system which holds out the possibility of change, but which manages to keep things the same.\nAnother factor that gets overlooked in the headlines, is that the results can be changed by who is taking the exam.\nThis year's nudge upwards in the pass rate has come alongside an older cohort.\nThere are fewer 14 and 15 year olds taking the gcses early, because the league tables now only recognise the first attempt.\nAnd another change in government policy means that pupils who missed out on gcse maths and english last year are having to re-sit the exam this year.\nThis means that more than 300,000 exam entries were from 17 year olds.\nBut if the changes at the overall level are measured in fractions of a percentage point, there are some very striking differences between england, northern ireland and wales.\nNorthern ireland's pupils are stretching their lead over everyone else, jumping by 0.7% to 78.7%.\nIt raises the question how such results can be achieved when only 66% make the grade in wales.\nNot only is the northern ireland figure far ahead of england, it is ahead of the highest-achieving part of england, which was london with 72%.\nEngland's education system has been in a state of almost constant reform since the late 1980s, but the latest results show it is northern ireland that is stretching further ahead.\nWhen these regional differences are overlaid with the gender gap, it means that young women in northern ireland are doing much better than anyone else.\nThe scores from the gcse top grades show the gap.\nAmong entries from female pupils in northern ireland, 11.4% achieve a* grades.\nAmong male pupils in wales, the figure is 4.5%.\nIn england, 5.2% of entries from male pupils and 7.9% of female achieve these highest a* grades.\nThis sets a pattern for a-levels and university entry, with northern irish women the most likely in the uk to get university places.\nWhether or not it is going to be consolation for england's school leaders, such comparisons are soon going to be impossible.\nBecause in a couple of years england's gcses will begin to be graded from 9 to 1 rather than a to g, ending a common system with wales and northern ireland.\nAnother curious aside is that many of the pupils taking gcses this year in england did not take their sats tests five years ago, because of a primary school teachers' boycott.\nWhat difference did it make in the long term?\nIt would take another exam to answer that one.", "summary": "The UK exams system sees a rise in pass rates and in English and maths, but pupils taking GCSEs now are older and boys are not doing as well as girls.

here you've had a nonhealing foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks [patient] okay sounds great thanks document [doctor] alright great", "summary": "Upon examination, the patient's foot appears red and painful with

.\n[patient] so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have , or really even what it is .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo how long have you had that for ?\nDo you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ?\n[patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur .\nSo of course , i'm worried as well .\n[doctor] got it .\nOkay .\nAnd are you having any symptoms at all ?\n[patient] i do n't think so .\nI do n't know what symptoms i should be having .\n[doctor] okay .\nWell , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one .\nSo i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?\n[patient] no , i definitely do n't .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?\n[patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain .\nUm , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs .\n[doctor] okay , got it , for the legs .\nAnd do you feel short of breath at all ?\n[patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?\n[patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know .\nMaybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .\n[doctor] got it .\nAll right .\n[patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all .\nUm , maybe more if i try to overdo it .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though .\n[doctor] okay , got it .\nAnd so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?\n[patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago .\nBefore that i did n't notice anything at all .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?\n[patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?\n[patient] yeah .\nSo i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd so how about any passing out at all ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay , good .\nAnd how about irregular heartbeats ?\nDo you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?\n[patient] i do n't notice it at all .\n[doctor] okay , great .\nAnd how about any swelling in the legs at all ?\n[patient] yeah , my ankles swell .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how long has this been going on ?\n[patient] um , i would say for probably six months .\nBut it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?\n[patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\nOkay .\n[patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] good .\nSo mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur .\nIs that right ?\nAnd sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?\n[patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd so fatigue as well .\nAnd have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?\n[patient] i'm not really sure .\n[doctor] okay .\nIt does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?\n[patient] yeah , you name it .\n[doctor] all right .\nWell , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record .\nUm , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ?\nAll right .\nGot them .\nAnd then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay , good .\nAnd looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack .\nIs that correct ?\n[patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .\n[doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment .\n[patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke .\nBut that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .\n[doctor] okay , i see .\n[patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .\n[doctor] okay .\nAll right .\nWell , it looks like also that you never smoked .\nThat's excellent .\nAnd then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?\n[patient] correct .\n[doctor] all right .\nWell , let's do a quick exam .\n[patient] all right .\nSounds good .\n[doctor] all right .\nWell , for physical exam , please use the regular template .\nAll right , please just breathe normally .\nGreat .\nAnd now take a few deep breaths for me .\nAll right .\nDo you feel okay ?\nAre you feeling any dizziness or anything ?\n[patient] no , i feel fine .\n[doctor] okay , great .\nAll right .\nWell , that is it for the exam .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right .\nSo what i'm thinking

\u00a32.5bn) to improve life in a number of african countries.\nThis in addition to the \u20ac20bn it already gives in aid to africa.\nSomalia's distinctly unimpressed prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke put it to the bbc that africa needed investment, not charity, to improve its economies.\nThe same as the us, the eu or anywhere else in the world, he said.\nIn fact, eu countries couldn't even muster the pledged extra cash.\nIt's a promise they seem unable or unwilling to keep.\nThe european commission says it will put in \u20ac1.8bn and wants the rest of the new fund made up by individual european nations.\nSo far they've coughed up less than \u20ac80m.\nThe eu was also unable to persuade/charm - some say bully - african countries into automatically receiving deported migrants back.\nInstead, in the written summit conclusions, the eu was forced to emphasise \"voluntary repatriations\".\nThat prompted obvious questions about the bloc's declared aim of \"speeding up the return\" of economic migrants and other failed asylum seekers - a key part of its plan to tackle the migrant crisis.\nIn short: the summit was not a resounding success.\nAnd a number of european newspapers were critical of the eu even trying to make a deal.\nGermany's sueddeutsche zeitung says the eu's offer of money to reduce the refugee numbers from africa could open the eu to accusations of \"showing its real values by co-operating with unjust regimes\".\nSimilar objections are raised when it comes to eu attempts to strike a deal with turkey - now the main departure point for refugees and other migrants crossing to europe.\nEu leaders are planning a turkey summit before the end of the year, but - as german chancellor angela merkel has pointed out - \"ankara holds the cards\".\nAnd diplomats worry that ankara will demand an extravagant bouquet in terms of money and political concessions - such as lifting visa restrictions, and accelerating turkey's eu membership bid - in exchange for help on migration.\nAnd again, critics challenge the eu for courting turkey at all - a country with an imperious president and dismal human rights record.\nThere are also those who say the eu's focus is far too fixed on creating \"fortress europe\", on keeping people out and not on introducing legal ways for them to come to over.\nBecause come they will.\nThe european commission expects about three million refugees and other migrants to arrive in europe by 2017.\nClearly, whatever the eu does during this crisis, it will come under fire from some quarter or another.\nAll too often, it comes up against itself - a behemoth of 28 nations, struggling to work together.\nEven the quota system - accepted (reluctantly) by most eu countries - to share out more equally the asylum seekers in europe is an unmitigated flop so far.\nAgreed number of people to be relocated: 160,000.\nPeople moved to date: 147.\nCross-border co-operation is disintegrating as barbed wire goes up and borders slam shut across europe: in slovenia, hungary, austria, sweden, norway\u2026 even germany is toughening border regulations.\nIn stark contrast to the warm welcome given to hundreds or thousands earlier this autumn, wolfgang schaeuble, germany's hugely popular finance minister, has begun to mutter darkly about a migrant \"avalanche\" engulfing his country.\nThere's little evidence of the eu - more of each country for itself.\nThat prompted the president of the european council, donald tusk, to warn that schengen, the eu agreement allowing passport-free travel across much of europe, risks collapse.\nYet it is one of the eu's proudest achievements.\nYou could argue schengen has already wilted and died.", "summary": "The European Union (EU) is attempting to tackle the migrant crisis by offering aid and attempting to persuade countries of origin and transit countries to reduce the flow of migrants to Europe.

have to i do n't know when it's something solid i kinda have to wash it down on occasion i i've never really fully choked but i have to admit that i've thought about potentially choking [doctor] okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing [patient] no coughing just kinda when i swallow it's all okay with liquids but when i kinda swallow you know like a bite of a sandwich sometimes it just feels like like i just need a little help pushing it down [doctor] okay and is it more kind of a like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that [patient] i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think it's probably more with solids [doctor] okay how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids is there is there a temperature change any modification to that [patient] it's really just about solids [doctor] okay alright so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all [patient] no [doctor] okay that so no vomiting blood no coughing up blood or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all [patient] not that i want [doctor] okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this [patient] no [doctor] okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven .\nFour we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going [patient] i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise [doctor] okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all [patient] yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time [doctor] and how are the numbers looking [patient] they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting [doctor] okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that [patient] no [doctor] okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home [patient] i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range [doctor] okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or get you referred to the er if needed any questions about that [patient] no that sounds great [doctor] okay and for the diabetes i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c i'm gon na order some more blood work today we'll check a kidney function and i notice that you have not had an eye referral so i'm gon na also give you an eye referral to ophthalmology to check your eyes for your diabetic for your for any retinopathy continue the metformin i'll have you come back in about a month and that way we'll have the results back for the blood test if we need to make any adjustments we can but i i wan na see you back in about a month and i think that's it for that any questions about that [patient] no [doctor] okay and the high blood pressure i think you're doing great continue with the norvasc if you have any issues certainly call me but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that did we forget anything or do you need refills for anything [patient] you know i think i'm low on the norvasc so if you could send something to my pharmacy that would be great [doctor] okay sure i'll get you a refill for norvasc we'll get that sent over to the pharmacy okay [patient] thank you [doctor] alright thanks good seeing you thanks for coming in to them", "summary": "The patient, Tyler, is a 56-year-old male who presents with difficulty swallowing.

was in my yard yesterday and i was raking leaves and i felt fine and then when i got into my house about two hours later my back started tightening up and i started getting pins and needles in my right foot [doctor] alright have you ever had this type of back pain before [patient] i had it once about three years ago but it went away after a day [doctor] okay and did you try anything for the pain yet did you take anything or have you have you tried icing [patient] put some ice on it and i tried two advils and it did n't help [doctor] okay does it get better when you're laying down sitting standing [patient] yeah i think the only thing that helped was a hot shower and it feels a little better when i sit [doctor] okay alright so you said you were raking leaves and now it's been kind of that weather outside for cleaning out the yard have you been doing a lot of yard work lately [patient] i i i normally do n't do any physical activity [doctor] yeah i hear you i make a i make my husband do all the yard work too so alright let me take a look at that low back if if you bend over does that hurt [patient] it hurts a little bit when i bend over yes [doctor] okay how about when you stand back up [patient] no pain [doctor] okay so no pain on extension some pain on flexion how about when i push right here on your back [patient] yeah that hurts [doctor] okay so some pain to palpation right around the l5 can i have that [patient] what happens when family members chime in like i'm doing right now because i actually think it was it hurts more when he stands up because i've watched him bend over but it's when he stands up that it really hurts [doctor] okay and and what's your relationship [patient] partners [doctor] okay so your partner is here with you today and reports that he is also having pain when you are standing up [patient] i've spent so many times you know who i am [doctor] so that's right you always come in together have you noticed anything else partner when when he is [patient] i'm worried about it because he is you know his pain tolerance is so high and he would n't be saying anything if it really was n't a problem because it's not at all like last week when he thought about raking leaves but did n't actually rake leaves but then his back did n't hurt as much but this time it really hurts [doctor] okay so you think this is more of a long term injury [patient] no he was just thinking about it hurting when he thought about raking but it did n't [doctor] okay alright and have you noticed any any prior pain with with the back [patient] i do n't want to take this away you better go back to talking to him [doctor] that's alright let's see how it turns out okay so how about if you if i push down on both your feet like this can you push back up on my hands [patient] can you repeat that [doctor] if i'm pushing down on your feet can you push push your feet back [patient] i [doctor] alright so your dorsiflexion is normal looks like pulses are equal in all extremities you said you had a little bit of a tingling sensation in which leg [patient] that would be my right leg [doctor] okay so some tingling in your right leg alright so i know that you had an x-ray when you came in because we always do x-rays when we have our patients come in of your low back and everything looks normal from that perspective so for your back pain sounds like you probably sprained your low back so i what i want you to do is let's rest it i'm going to prescribe some meloxicam have you taken that before [patient] i have not taken meloxicam [doctor] alright so i'll prescribe that i'm also gon na prescribe some physical therapy i know you said you have n't been overly active and your partner reported the same thing for a long time so we might wan na get you into some pt and hopefully get you back back in shape get you some stretches that you can do and some exercises and then you know if it's not improving i want you to send me a message and we can possibly look into see if there is anything else going on potentially an mri if it's still not improving does that sound like an okay plan [patient] it sounds reasonable [doctor] alright [patient] i think he should have an mri now i think he had surgery yesterday i think he should have an mri now this it's been hurting for like six hours now and she had an mri we are really worried about it [doctor] alright you know let's give it a couple of weeks and let's give it two weeks and then call me back and we'll get you an mri if it's still not improving [patient] good answer [doctor]

complaining of difficulty swallowing and has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure so tyler tell me what's going on with your swallowing problem [patient] well it's just been something that i have noticed over the last you know four to five weeks it seems like something is always stuck in my throat and you know just i kinda go about my day and it kinda bothers me you know a little bit sometimes a little painful and when i try to eat it just seems like i have to i do n't know when it's something solid i kinda have to wash it down on occasion i i've never really fully choked but i have to admit that i've thought about potentially choking [doctor] okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing [patient] no coughing just kinda when i swallow it's all okay with liquids but when i kinda swallow you know like a bite of a sandwich sometimes it just feels like like i just need a little help pushing it down [doctor] okay and is it more kind of a like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that [patient] i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think it's probably more with solids [doctor] okay how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids is there is there a temperature change any modification to that [patient] it's really just about solids [doctor] okay alright so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all [patient] no [doctor] okay that so no vomiting blood no coughing up blood or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all [patient] not that i want [doctor] okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this [patient] no [doctor] okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven .\nFour we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going [patient] i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise [doctor] okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all [patient] yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time [doctor] and how are the numbers looking [patient] they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting [doctor] okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that [patient] no [doctor] okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home [patient] i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range [doctor] okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or get you referred to the er if needed any questions about that [patient] no that sounds great [doctor] okay and for the diabetes i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c i'm gon na order some more blood work today we'll check a kidney function and i notice that you have not had an eye referral so i'm gon na also give you an eye referral to ophthalmology to check your eyes for your diabetic for your for any retinopathy continue the metformin i'll have you come back in about a month and that way we'll have the results back for the blood test if we need to make any adjustments we can but i i wan na see you back in about a month and i think that's it for that any questions about that [patient] no [doctor] okay and the high blood pressure i think you're doing great continue with the norvasc if you have any issues certainly call me but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that did we forget anything or do you need refills for anything [patient] you know i think i'm low on the norvasc so if you could send something to my pharmacy that would be great [doctor] okay

?\n[patient] no , i have n't .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how long have you been considering this ?\n[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years .\nBut i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .\n[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .\n[patient] okay , that's reassuring .\n[doctor] yeah .\nSo what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having .\nAnd then i'll do a quick exam .\n[patient] okay .\nThat sounds good .\n[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails .\nAnd , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?\n[patient] i have blue cross blue shield .\nWell , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .\n[doctor] okay .\nWhat we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company .\nAnd what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not .\nBut we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance .\nDo you know when you'll be on the new plan ?\n[patient] most likely july .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?\n[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years .\nI do have a lotta pain here and here .\nBut i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not .\nIt gets painful and builds up .\nSo i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd in your neck and your upper back .\nAnd how long has this been going on ?\nWould you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?\n[patient] i would say since i was in high school .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ?\nUm , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .\n[patient] yes .\nI do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often .\nI mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable .\nAnd the others are expensive in my size .\n[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well .\nAnd , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?\n[patient] no , i do not have any kids now .\nBut we might plan to in the future .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?\n[patient] sometimes , yes .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ?\nAnd , and it could be from sweating .\n[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?\n[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running .\nAnd it hurts .\n[doctor] and it hurts , okay .\nAnd , and you saw a chiropractor .\nBut what about physical therapy for your back pain ?\nOr do you take any pain medicine for it ?\n[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .\n[doctor] that's okay .\nSo let's see .\nI know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family .\nHave you had any mammograms ?\nAnd how old was your mother when she had it ?\n[patient] mom was 40 .\nAnd they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram .\nI'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 .\nSo i'm still a little bit young .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?\n[patient] yes , for the most part .\nI lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .\n[doctor] congratulations .\nThat's great .\nAnd then , um- [patient] thank you .\n[doctor] .\nSo then ... you're welcome .\nAnd so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ?\nAnd then , um , you said that you were going to school .\nWhat are you going to school for ?\n[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .\n[doctor] okay , that's great .\nAll right .\nSo what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look .\nI'm gon na take a couple of measurements .\nAnd we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards .\nUm , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia .\nOkay .\nSo , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] okay .\nWell , thank you so much .\nIt looks like i have all the measurements that we need .\nYou can go ahead and cover up now .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction .\nWhen we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .\n[patient] okay .\nThat's fine .\n[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to

with it this comes and this happens right [patient] exactly [doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions [patient] no i ca n't recall any family members [doctor] okay alright and do you smoke [patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago [doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here [patient] okay [doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit [patient] okay that's painful [doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that [patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time [doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year [patient] okay okay [doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour [patient] okay [doctor] okay [patient] alright sounds good [doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection [patient] alright thank you [doctor] alright thank you [patient] bye", "summary": "The patient has a history of chronic back pain and pain that radiates down the leg.

and the even smaller decline in the proportion of top a* and a grades - is that there is \"stability\".\nThis isn't an accident.\nThe annual exam results are not like going outside and measuring the temperature as a natural phenomenon which might fluctuate.\nIt's more like setting the central heating to an agreed level and then holding up a thermometer to see if the temperature is where it should be.\nWell, perhaps that's not a complete analogy, but the national exam statistics, with their neat similarity to last year, are a work of design rather than nature.\nThe huge annual challenge for the exam system is to balance a number of competing demands.\nThere has to be room for some slight ups and downs, but there mustn't be grade inflation, standards have to be maintained over time and - at the very heart of the process - it has to be a fair reward for the hard work of individual pupils.\nAdd to this complex equation the need to adjust grades between different exam boards.\nHead teachers' leader brian lightman has complained that below the smooth surface of the national statistics, there can be doubts about the reliability of individual results.\nHe has warned of \"volatility\", with heads unable to explain sudden dips and spikes, problems that remain unnoticed from a national perspective.\n\"it is devastating for a student who has been on course for a certain grade to miss what they were expected to achieve and it is mystifying to their teachers,\" said mr lightman.\nThe lingering question is if one year's results are reverse engineered to be very similar to the year before, does this mean distorting some of the results to make sure that they fit?\nAre there winners and losers in some subjects and at some grades?\nOfqual has always argued that fairness for individual students is not compromised by the demands of the wider results system.\nBut it's a massively complicated challenge for exam boards and regulator - made even more difficult by the conflicting legacies of previous grading systems.\nOnce there was a system of fixed quotas which prevented any rise in grades and then a system which allowed grades to rise every single year.\nNow there is a system which holds out the possibility of change, but which manages to keep things the same.\nAnother factor that gets overlooked in the headlines, is that the results can be changed by who is taking the exam.\nThis year's nudge upwards in the pass rate has come alongside an older cohort.\nThere are fewer 14 and 15 year olds taking the gcses early, because the league tables now only recognise the first attempt.\nAnd another change in government policy means that pupils who missed out on gcse maths and english last year are having to re-sit the exam this year.\nThis means that more than 300,000 exam entries were from 17 year olds.\nBut if the changes at the overall level are measured in fractions of a percentage point, there are some very striking differences between england, northern ireland and wales.\nNorthern ireland's pupils are stretching their lead over everyone else, jumping by 0.7% to 78.7%.\nIt raises the question how such results can be achieved when only 66% make the grade in wales.\nNot only is the northern ireland figure far ahead of england, it is ahead of the highest-achieving part of england, which was london with 72%.\nEngland's education system has been in a state of almost constant reform since the late 1980s, but the latest results show it is northern ireland that is stretching further ahead.\nWhen these regional differences are overlaid with the gender gap, it means that young women in northern ireland are doing much better than anyone else.\nThe scores from the gcse top grades show the gap.\nAmong entries from female pupils in northern ireland, 11.4% achieve a* grades.\nAmong male pupils in wales, the figure is 4.5%.\nIn england, 5.2% of entries from male pupils and 7.9% of female achieve these highest a* grades.\nThis sets a pattern for a-levels and university entry, with northern irish women the most likely in the uk to get university places.\nWhether or not it is going to be consolation for england's school leaders, such comparisons are soon going to be impossible.\nBecause in a couple of years england's gcses will begin to be graded from 9 to 1 rather than a to g, ending a common system with wales and northern ireland.\nAnother curious aside is that many of the pupils taking gcses this year in england did not take their sats tests five years ago, because of a primary school teachers' boycott.\nWhat difference did it make in the long term?\nIt would take another exam to answer that one.", "summary": "The GCSE results have been published, showing a slight increase in the pass rate from 68.8% to 69%, representing an improvement for over 10,000 exam entries.

back [patient] yeah that hurts [doctor] okay so some pain to palpation right around the l5 can i have that [patient] what happens when family members chime in like i'm doing right now because i actually think it was it hurts more when he stands up because i've watched him bend over but it's when he stands up that it really hurts [doctor] okay and and what's your relationship [patient] partners [doctor] okay so your partner is here with you today and reports that he is also having pain when you are standing up [patient] i've spent so many times you know who i am [doctor] so that's right you always come in together have you noticed anything else partner when when he is [patient] i'm worried about it because he is you know his pain tolerance is so high and he would n't be saying anything if it really was n't a problem because it's not at all like last week when he thought about raking leaves but did n't actually rake leaves but then his back did n't hurt as much but this time it really hurts [doctor] okay so you think this is more of a long term injury [patient] no he was just thinking about it hurting when he thought about raking but it did n't [doctor] okay alright and have you noticed any any prior pain with with the back [patient] i do n't want to take this away you better go back to talking to him [doctor] that's alright let's see how it turns out okay so how about if you if i push down on both your feet like this can you push back up on my hands [patient] can you repeat that [doctor] if i'm pushing down on your feet can you push push your feet back [patient] i [doctor] alright so your dorsiflexion is normal looks like pulses are equal in all extremities you said you had a little bit of a tingling sensation in which leg [patient] that would be my right leg [doctor] okay so some tingling in your right leg alright so i know that you had an x-ray when you came in because we always do x-rays when we have our patients come in of your low back and everything looks normal from that perspective so for your back pain sounds like you probably sprained your low back so i what i want you to do is let's rest it i'm going to prescribe some meloxicam have you taken that before [patient] i have not taken meloxicam [doctor] alright so i'll prescribe that i'm also gon na prescribe some physical therapy i know you said you have n't been overly active and your partner reported the same thing for a long time so we might wan na get you into some pt and hopefully get you back back in shape get you some stretches that you can do and some exercises and then you know if it's not improving i want you to send me a message and we can possibly look into see if there is anything else going on potentially an mri if it's still not improving does that sound like an okay plan [patient] it sounds reasonable [doctor] alright [patient] i think he should have an mri now i think he had surgery yesterday i think he should have an mri now this it's been hurting for like six hours now and she had an mri we are really worried about it [doctor] alright you know let's give it a couple of weeks and let's give it two weeks and then call me back and we'll get you an mri if it's still not improving [patient] good answer [doctor] alright alright hope you feel better", "summary": "Bryan experienced sudden back pain and right foot tingling after raking leaves.

.\nWell , what brings you in to see me today ?\n[patient] well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have , or really even what it is .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo how long have you had that for ?\nDo you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ?\n[patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur .\nSo of course , i'm worried as well .\n[doctor] got it .\nOkay .\nAnd are you having any symptoms at all ?\n[patient] i do n't think so .\nI do n't know what symptoms i should be having .\n[doctor] okay .\nWell , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one .\nSo i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?\n[patient] no , i definitely do n't .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?\n[patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain .\nUm , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs .\n[doctor] okay , got it , for the legs .\nAnd do you feel short of breath at all ?\n[patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?\n[patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know .\nMaybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .\n[doctor] got it .\nAll right .\n[patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all .\nUm , maybe more if i try to overdo it .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though .\n[doctor] okay , got it .\nAnd so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?\n[patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago .\nBefore that i did n't notice anything at all .\n[doctor] okay .\nSo do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?\n[patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?\n[patient] yeah .\nSo i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd so how about any passing out at all ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay , good .\nAnd how about irregular heartbeats ?\nDo you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?\n[patient] i do n't notice it at all .\n[doctor] okay , great .\nAnd how about any swelling in the legs at all ?\n[patient] yeah , my ankles swell .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how long has this been going on ?\n[patient] um , i would say for probably six months .\nBut it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?\n[patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\nOkay .\n[patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] good .\nSo mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur .\nIs that right ?\nAnd sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?\n[patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .\n[doctor] okay .\nAnd so fatigue as well .\nAnd have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?\n[patient] i'm not really sure .\n[doctor] okay .\nIt does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?\n[patient] yeah , you name it .\n[doctor] all right .\nWell , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record .\nUm , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ?\nAll right .\nGot them .\nAnd then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay , good .\nAnd looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack .\nIs that correct ?\n[patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .\n[doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment .\n[patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke .\nBut that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .\n[doctor] okay , i see .\n[patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .\n[doctor] okay .\nAll right .\nWell , it looks like also that you never smoked .\nThat's excellent .\nAnd then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?\n[patient] correct .\n[doctor] all right .\nWell , let's do a quick exam .\n[patient] all right .\nSounds good .\n[doctor] all right .\nWell , for physical exam , please use the regular template .\nAll right , please just breathe normally .\nGreat .\nAnd now take a few deep breaths for me .\nAll right .\nDo you feel okay ?\nAre you feeling any dizziness or anything ?\n[patient] no , i feel fine .\n[doctor] okay , great .\nAll right .\nWell , that is it for the exam .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right .\nSo what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram

millions of pounds of damage to crops if left untreated.\nUsually, if you want to study an animal, you do a survey and count it.\nThe problem with slugs is you can't always see them as they spend much of their time out of sight in the top 10cm (4in) of the ground.\nBut improved tracking technology will allow scientists to accurately follow slug movements for the first time.\nThe aim of the research is to answer an interesting problem facing farmers: how do slugs live amongst their crops?\nThe researchers at harper adams university have a theory slugs are not evenly distributed over a field.\nInstead they believe they are concentrated in patches.\nThat's important because if the scientists could help farmers find these large patches of slugs you could target them with pest control measures.\nThat would be cheaper and greener than spreading chemicals over an entire field.\nSlugs are slimy and enjoy squeezing into tight spaces so the trackers need to be placed inside the slugs themselves just under the skin.\nThe slugs are anaesthetised before a small cut is made in the skin and the tracker inserted.\nThe tracker itself is smaller than a grain of rice.\nThe slugs i saw were implanted a month ago and seemed happy.\nIt's important to the researchers that the trackers don't cause the slugs to behave any differently to their non-implanted cousins.\nIn the lab it appears neither slug movement or appetite is affected.\nTracking the slugs involves equipment that looks very like a metal detector.\nResearchers will go out at night when the slugs are most active and release the slugs with the trackers.\nThere will be hundreds of them over the duration of the experiment.\nThen every 20 minutes throughout the night the team will scan the fields with the detector.\nThis will automatically log the slug's individual tracker number and it's gps location building up a very accurate map of where the slugs go and what they are doing.\nThere's increasing pressure on farmers to reduce the chemicals they use against slugs and some are being banned outright.\nSo if this research comes up with a better way to control them by revealing more about their behaviour it could be very useful.\nFunding for this study has come from the agriculture and horticulture development board (ahdb), the potato council and cereals and oilseeds who estimate that slugs could cause \u00e2\u00a3100m of damage to uk crops if they aren't properly controlled.\nAnd finally a confession.\nWe did take a slug out into the field and we put it down on the ground to track it.\nWe certainly managed to find it again, the signal from its tracker was loud and strong, but we couldn't actually see it.\nWhich means we couldn't recover the slug and he had to go and join his colleagues in the soil.\nIt did rather show how trackers beat traditional visual slug surveys.\nAnd soon our slug implanted with a tracker will be joined by hundreds more.\nUpdate: one week on and our slug was safely recovered by the team.", "summary": "Harper Adams University is implanting tracking devices in slugs to study their behavior.

\u00a32.5bn) to improve life in a number of african countries.\nThis in addition to the \u20ac20bn it already gives in aid to africa.\nSomalia's distinctly unimpressed prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke put it to the bbc that africa needed investment, not charity, to improve its economies.\nThe same as the us, the eu or anywhere else in the world, he said.\nIn fact, eu countries couldn't even muster the pledged extra cash.\nIt's a promise they seem unable or unwilling to keep.\nThe european commission says it will put in \u20ac1.8bn and wants the rest of the new fund made up by individual european nations.\nSo far they've coughed up less than \u20ac80m.\nThe eu was also unable to persuade/charm - some say bully - african countries into automatically receiving deported migrants back.\nInstead, in the written summit conclusions, the eu was forced to emphasise \"voluntary repatriations\".\nThat prompted obvious questions about the bloc's declared aim of \"speeding up the return\" of economic migrants and other failed asylum seekers - a key part of its plan to tackle the migrant crisis.\nIn short: the summit was not a resounding success.\nAnd a number of european newspapers were critical of the eu even trying to make a deal.\nGermany's sueddeutsche zeitung says the eu's offer of money to reduce the refugee numbers from africa could open the eu to accusations of \"showing its real values by co-operating with unjust regimes\".\nSimilar objections are raised when it comes to eu attempts to strike a deal with turkey - now the main departure point for refugees and other migrants crossing to europe.\nEu leaders are planning a turkey summit before the end of the year, but - as german chancellor angela merkel has pointed out - \"ankara holds the cards\".\nAnd diplomats worry that ankara will demand an extravagant bouquet in terms of money and political concessions - such as lifting visa restrictions, and accelerating turkey's eu membership bid - in exchange for help on migration.\nAnd again, critics challenge the eu for courting turkey at all - a country with an imperious president and dismal human rights record.\nThere are also those who say the eu's focus is far too fixed on creating \"fortress europe\", on keeping people out and not on introducing legal ways for them to come to over.\nBecause come they will.\nThe european commission expects about three million refugees and other migrants to arrive in europe by 2017.\nClearly, whatever the eu does during this crisis, it will come under fire from some quarter or another.\nAll too often, it comes up against itself - a behemoth of 28 nations, struggling to work together.\nEven the quota system - accepted (reluctantly) by most eu countries - to share out more equally the asylum seekers in europe is an unmitigated flop so far.\nAgreed number of people to be relocated: 160,000.\nPeople moved to date: 147.\nCross-border co-operation is disintegrating as barbed wire goes up and borders slam shut across europe: in slovenia, hungary, austria, sweden, norway\u2026 even germany is toughening border regulations.\nIn stark contrast to the warm welcome given to hundreds or thousands earlier this autumn, wolfgang schaeuble, germany's hugely popular finance minister, has begun to mutter darkly about a migrant \"avalanche\" engulfing his country.\nThere's little evidence of the eu - more of each country for itself.\nThat prompted the president of the european council, donald tusk, to warn that schengen, the eu agreement allowing passport-free travel across much of europe, risks collapse.\nYet it is one of the eu's proudest achievements.\nYou could argue schengen has already wilted and died.", "summary": "The UK has warned Schengen, the European agreement that allows passport-free travel, could collapse as barbed wire and borders slam shut across Europe.

or else the actors themselves carry candles.\nLight and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era.\n\"darkness was a terrifying presence,\" says dr karim-cooper.\n\"darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick.\nIt was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.\"\nShe says that if elizabethans or jacobeans travelled in time to modern london \"their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light\".\nAnother big difference is that shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.\nThe modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.\nIn the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen.\nThe really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.\nAnd one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.\n\"it was a very social occasion,\" says dr karim-cooper, describing the shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.\n\"contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,\" she says.\nPutting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.\nFor instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says dr karim-cooper.\nModern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue.\nWhen the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.\nThere are other big changes between a modern and shakespearean theatre visit.\nIt would have smelled very different, says dr karim-cooper.\nThere would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.\nAnother sensory difference would have been the \"soundscape\", she says.\nIt would have been a much softer sound, as elizabethan london didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.\n\"in terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,\" she says.\n\"there are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming.\nThey never heard a plane taking off.\"\nThe language would have sounded unusual too.\nThe accent of the time would have meant words such as \"move\" and \"love\" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.\nAnd the globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.\nThe role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.\n\"there is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do.\nIt wouldn't work,\" says dr karim-cooper.\nInstead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions.\nThey pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.\n\"we want to get beyond wikipedia,\" she says.\nShe is co-editor of moving shakespeare indoors, a collection of essays on indoor jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the globe's work.\nThere is a postgraduate degree course in shakespeare studies with king's college, london.\nThere are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers.\nEvery year there is a landmark schools production, the playing shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for london pupils.\nIt's been a huge success, with many  coming to see shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before.\nDr karim-cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory.\n\"we want to become a research hub.\nWe want students to be here.\"\nThe \"unique blend\" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the \"literary rigour\".\n\"we don't separate the practical from the academic.\"", "summary": "The Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in London is a unique combination of academia and theatre, with a team of scholars, researchers, and academic advisors informing every aspect of the theatre's operation.

larry how are you doing today [patient] i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you for this back pain that i've been having for a couple of years now [doctor] okay [patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially [patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend [doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me [patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe [doctor] okay [patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah [doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain [patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot [doctor] okay [patient] let me separate these [doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area [patient] no nothing like that [doctor] okay now do you have any weakness [patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no [doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels [patient] no [doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they [patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery [doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like [patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years [doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf [patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back [doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right [patient] exactly [doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions [patient] no i ca n't recall any family members [doctor] okay alright and do you smoke [patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago [doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here [patient] okay [doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit [patient] okay that's painful [doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that [patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time [doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year [patient] okay okay [doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour [patient] okay [doctor] okay [patient] alright sounds good [doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection [patient] alright thank you [doctor] alright

\u00a32.5bn) to improve life in a number of african countries.\nThis in addition to the \u20ac20bn it already gives in aid to africa.\nSomalia's distinctly unimpressed prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke put it to the bbc that africa needed investment, not charity, to improve its economies.\nThe same as the us, the eu or anywhere else in the world, he said.\nIn fact, eu countries couldn't even muster the pledged extra cash.\nIt's a promise they seem unable or unwilling to keep.\nThe european commission says it will put in \u20ac1.8bn and wants the rest of the new fund made up by individual european nations.\nSo far they've coughed up less than \u20ac80m.\nThe eu was also unable to persuade/charm - some say bully - african countries into automatically receiving deported migrants back.\nInstead, in the written summit conclusions, the eu was forced to emphasise \"voluntary repatriations\".\nThat prompted obvious questions about the bloc's declared aim of \"speeding up the return\" of economic migrants and other failed asylum seekers - a key part of its plan to tackle the migrant crisis.\nIn short: the summit was not a resounding success.\nAnd a number of european newspapers were critical of the eu even trying to make a deal.\nGermany's sueddeutsche zeitung says the eu's offer of money to reduce the refugee numbers from africa could open the eu to accusations of \"showing its real values by co-operating with unjust regimes\".\nSimilar objections are raised when it comes to eu attempts to strike a deal with turkey - now the main departure point for refugees and other migrants crossing to europe.\nEu leaders are planning a turkey summit before the end of the year, but - as german chancellor angela merkel has pointed out - \"ankara holds the cards\".\nAnd diplomats worry that ankara will demand an extravagant bouquet in terms of money and political concessions - such as lifting visa restrictions, and accelerating turkey's eu membership bid - in exchange for help on migration.\nAnd again, critics challenge the eu for courting turkey at all - a country with an imperious president and dismal human rights record.\nThere are also those who say the eu's focus is far too fixed on creating \"fortress europe\", on keeping people out and not on introducing legal ways for them to come to over.\nBecause come they will.\nThe european commission expects about three million refugees and other migrants to arrive in europe by 2017.\nClearly, whatever the eu does during this crisis, it will come under fire from some quarter or another.\nAll too often, it comes up against itself - a behemoth of 28 nations, struggling to work together.\nEven the quota system - accepted (reluctantly) by most eu countries - to share out more equally the asylum seekers in europe is an unmitigated flop so far.\nAgreed number of people to be relocated: 160,000.\nPeople moved to date: 147.\nCross-border co-operation is disintegrating as barbed wire goes up and borders slam shut across europe: in slovenia, hungary, austria, sweden, norway\u2026 even germany is toughening border regulations.\nIn stark contrast to the warm welcome given to hundreds or thousands earlier this autumn, wolfgang schaeuble, germany's hugely popular finance minister, has begun to mutter darkly about a migrant \"avalanche\" engulfing his country.\nThere's little evidence of the eu - more of each country for itself.\nThat prompted the president of the european council, donald tusk, to warn that schengen, the eu agreement allowing passport-free travel across much of europe, risks collapse.\nYet it is one of the eu's proudest achievements.\nYou could argue schengen has already wilted and died.", "summary": "The European Union (EU) has been struggling to handle the recent surge of migrants and refugees arriving in Europe.

then if i push here does that hurt too [patient] yeah a little bit [doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is

monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches [patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did

we'll get you back out doing some exercise again [patient] okay [doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly [patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out [doctor] yeah i i'm a dog walker as

probably lifting those as well and then [patient] yeah [doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or [patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of [doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven .\nEight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan [patient] no that sounds good [doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay [patient] sounds great [doctor] okay thanks [patient] thanks [doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or [patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but [doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that [patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good", "summary": "The document discusses a patient who is
